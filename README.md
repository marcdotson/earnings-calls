Text Analysis of Marketing Language in Financial Earnings Call
Transcripts
================

## Abstract

Earnings calls provide an opportunity to present a company’s financial
results, but they are also used to sell investors on the company’s
future success. When and how frequently marketing is referenced during
earnings calls remains an open question. We develop a marketing term
dictionary to use for text analysis within financial contexts. Employing
this dictionary, we conduct a text analysis of over 130,000 earnings
call transcripts from 2001-2020, exploring how frequently marketing
terms are used, the underlying sentiment that accompanies marketing term
usage, and how marketing terms relate to objective company performance
metrics such as earnings per share (EPS). We demonstrate that in
general, marketing terms are positively associated with positive
sentiment, inversely associated with negative sentiment, and positively
associated with higher firm performance, with stronger effects for
consumer focused and marketing-centric companies.
