The data cleaning functions that I found in the tutorials were very slow though, so it may be worth either doing data preprocessing in R and then putting it directly into the `build_corpus()`function or tokenizing using an [NLTK function](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html)"

All rights reserved. Presentation. OPERATOR: Good morning and welcome to the Beazer Homes Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. Today\\'s calling is being recorded and a replay will be available on the Company\\'s website later today. In addition, PowerPoint slides intended to accompany this call are available on the Investor Relations section of the company\\'s at www.beazer.com[http://www.beazer.com]. At this point I will now turn the call to have Carey Phelps, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin. CAREY PHELPS, DIRECTOR, IR, BEAZER HOMES: Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, and welcome to the Beazer Homes conference discussing our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Before we begin you should be aware that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which are described I think our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, that may cause actual results to differ materially. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which statement is made, and except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors. Joining me today are Allan Merrill, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Salomon, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks we will take questions in the time remaining. I will now turn the call over to Alan. ALLAN MERRILL, PRESIDENT, CEO, BEAZER HOMES: Thank you, Carey, and thank you for joining us. We had a very productive second quarter. Our operational improvements and better market conditions, which began to emerge last fall, have continued into the start of our spring selling season. Traffic is encouraging and our efforts are delivering solid results. Overall for the quarter adjusted EBITDA was $15 million an improvement of over $16 million from last year. We recorded 3.4 sales per community per months which exceeded our expectations. Despite a 20% decline in our average community count and an intense focus on increasing our margins, orders were up slightly year-over-year based on the stronger than anticipated performance. Our cancellation rate declined 380 basis points to 18.7%. Closings were up 34%, wit and average sales price that was 13% higher than a year-ago. Gross margin improved to 19.1% with each closing contributing $48,000 in gross profit. Ending backlog was 12% higher in units and 26% higher in dollars than a year-ago. And finally we spent $63 million in land and land development during the quarter, entered into a $150 million land banking arrangement, and activated a $12 million asset out of land held for future development, all in support of our drive to return to profitability as soon as possible. Last November we introduced target ranges for our four primary operational metrics, illustrating our path to profitability. There\\'s progress to report on all four fronts. First, taking a look at our sales per community. For the four quarters ended March 31, we averaged 2.7 sales per community per month, comfortably with within our target range of 2.5 to 2.75, and 87% of our qualified as performing with at least one sale per month. Both metrics reflect improvement were this time last year when we recorded two sales per community per month with 73% of our communities performing. I\\'m very proud of the 3.4 sales per month absorption rates achieved by our sales teams this spring even as they have embraced our priority to drive margin expansion. While we don\\'t expect to repeat absorptions over three per month in another quarter this year, we are raising the top end of our target range to three sales per community per month measured on a trailing 12-month basis. The second path to profitability strategy relates to our G&A costs. For the 12 months ended March 31, we reduced G&A as a percentage of revenues by 440 basis points from 13.9% last year to 9.5% this year, at the mid-point of our target range. As we continue to grow our topline, I anticipate staying within this band of 9% to 10%. Our third path to profitability strategy is to drive higher gross profit dollars per closing. As we have discussed before, achieving this objective is a function of increasing both our margin percentage, which we hope to expand to at least 20% and realizing higher ASPs. With continued improvement in all three reporting segments, our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 19.1% compared with 17.5% last year. Despite continuing material and labor costs pressures, I anticipate positive year-over-year gross margin comparisons in each of the next two quarters. Average sales prices are also notably improved over last year. For the second quarter, our ASP grew to $253,000, up $29,000, or 13% and our ASP in backlog at the end of the quarter was $264,000, up 12% over last year. Together, our improved margin percentage and increased ASPs are driving our gross profit dollars per closing higher. For the 12 months ended March 31, we recorded and average of $41,500 of gross profit per closing, up 16% from a year-ago and moving us closer to our target regular of $45,000 to $50,000 on a trailing 12 month basis. On this slide you can see that our performance for the second quarter was even stronger with $48,000 of gross profit per closing. Because of this solid performance we are raising the top end of our target range to $55,000 per closing, stretching our goals to reflect our improving trends. Moving now to the fourth strategy in our path to profitability plan. As we guided on our last call, our active community count has remained relatively stable as our 18 new community openings during the second quarter were offset by 20 community closeouts. At March 31, we had 148 active communities and our average for the quarter was 150, below our longer-term target range of 190 to 210. The good news is that with the improvements we\\'ve made in our other packet to profitability metrics, we\\'ll be able to return to profitability well before we return to 190 communities. For that reason we have lowered the bottom end of our target range to 170 communities, which is an achievable target in the next 12 months. We are making the investments necessary to grow community count next year, emphasizing investments in California, Florida, Texas, and the mid-Atlantic region. I will let Bob provide a few more details on these activities before he discuss our expectations for the remainder of the year. Bob. BOB SALOMON, CFO, BEAZER HOMES: Thanks, Allan. We spent $62.6 million in land and land development during the quarter. Year-to-date we have spent $152.6 million, or 52% more, than we spent for the same six month period last year. While there is competition for the best sites, we are finding and aggressively pursuing those deals that meet our investment criteria to generate deliveries for gain in fiscal 2014 or 2015. As Allan said, at March 31, we had 148 active communities. In addition, we also had 33 communities under development but not yet open, and 24 new communities approved for acquisition but had not yet closed. At the end of the quarter, our land committee approved and additional 11 communities for acquisition. These new communities will add to our average community count next year but will partially offset by community closeouts. To further enhance our efforts to grow our community count at the end of March, we entered into $150 million land banking arrangement with GSO. This relationship has nothing to do with existing assets. Instead, it should enable us to open approximately 20 more communities than we had planned using our own capital and we\\'re off to a fast start. We expect to have several land deals in the land bank by the end of the third quarter. Based on our current pipeline I expect to spend in excess of $120 million on land and land development during the third quarter, and for the full year fiscal 2013 I expect our total land and land development spend to be in the $550 million range, of which $450 million or so will be from our own cash and at least $100 million will be part of the land banking arrangement. At March 31, we controlled nearly 24,700 lots including 6500 that were immediately available for use and almost 12,000 lots that are under development or under option which are available in the near-term. During the quarter we activated a $12 million asset in Phoenix from land held for future development containing over 500 lots. When fully developed these lots will have a basis below current market prices for lots in this particular submarket. We will likely activate additional communities in fiscal 2013 with more expected next year. There are several assets located in Sacramento, valued at approximately $80 million, that are impacted by levee repairs. These assets will remain in land held for future development until those repairs are complete. Turning now to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $426 million of unrestricted cash and an undrawn $150 million revolver. With these available resources, and no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2016, we feel very good about our liquidity position, capital structure and ability to meet our path to profitability objectives. Similar to most of our competitors, we have a very large deferred tax asset, which will allow us to avoid paying cash taxes on a significant amount of our net income in the future. We currently estimate the realizable savings to be on the order of $450 million, or $13 a share. This asset is subject to a valuation allowance not on our balance sheet until we return to sustainable profitability. Regardless of when we remove the valuation allowance, the ability to avoid cash takes he is represents an important financial attribute of the company. Overall, I\\'m very pleased with our performance this quarter and the significant strides we are making to return the company to profitability. With that I will turn the call to Allan to go through our expectations for the rest of the year. ALLAN MERRILL: Thanks, Bob. Across all of our markets, we are executing our path to profitability strategies. We have improved our sales per community even as we have successfully expanded our gross margins. Based on this progress, and our current backlog, we now expect to report positive net income for our fiscal fourth quarter, allowing us to be profitable for the second half of fiscal 2013. That would be the first time since 2006 that we were profitable from operations for any cumulative six month period. At a more detailed level I\\'m pleased to announce that we have raised our expectations for adjusted EBITDA for this year. Based on our solid results to date, we now expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $70 million, up $20 million from our previous projection, and nearly $50 million higher than we reported last year. These improvements are driven by year-over-year growth in closings, increases in our ASP, improvements in our gross margin percentage and dollars and modest additional leverage of our overhead costs. Year to date, our orders are up about 10% as a result of better than expected absorption rates. With the continuing headwinds of the smaller community count, for the second half of the year we\\'ll be happy to simply match last year\\'s orders, implying full year growth of about 5%. More precisely we expect Q3 orders to be below last year with a resumption of order growth in Q4. As we have said many times, our top priority is to return to profitability as quickly as possible and, almost as often as we have said that, we have been asked when that objective will be achieved. Although it is still very early to make forecasts about next year, we now believe that full year profitability for fiscal 2014 is attainable. It\\'s not layup, and a substantial downturn in-housing demand or home prices would clearly make it less likely, but if we sustain our path to profitability improvements, and success me launch our new communities, 2014 should be our first profitable year in almost a decade. Thank you for your interest today. We look forward to sharing our continued progress in the quarters to come, and at this point we will be happy to take your questions in the time remaining. Operator. Questions and Answers. OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ivy Zelman with Zelman Associates. Your line is now open. IVY ZELMAN, ANALYST, ZELMAN ASSOCIATES: Good morning. Congratulations, guys. Alan, that\\'s a hell of a birthday present to have such a great quarter so you must be a happy guy. I think what we would like to drill in first just to clarify your percentages increases in pricing how much of that is mix-related? And then, if you can just give us a sense -- I mean your goals and your path to profitability are clearly coming to fruition you\\'re closing the gap. When you look at your 19% gross margin, the improvement is impressive, but recognizing that it\\'s still below the 20% gross margins that you figure underwriting to, so what can we expect going forward that will be dependent upon price for gross margin improvement as opposed to just the operational improvements that you continue to obviously bring to the -- to the finish line, and how much more kinds of low hanging fruit is there? That\\'s my first question. ALLAN MERRILL: Okay. Boy, that was a lot of questions. I will try and weave through some of that. Let\\'s talk about margins. There are a couple of things that we said this morning I think that are important. You know, we\\'re very confident that we can drive additional gross margin percentages and dollars. It\\'s why we\\'ve raised our target for where we want to get in -- in the next year or two and I think the $48,000 in this quarter was a clear function of both the percentage and the sales prices. I think the other thing we said and this isn\\'t really in your question, but I want to make sure I point it out. We\\'ve always cautioned folks against making sequential gross margin compares sons it\\'s really why we focus on the year over year. As we look at our backlog, as we look at what we\\'ve been selling this spring, I\\'m very confident we\\'re going to be up nicely year-over-year in both Q3 and Q4 in terms ever of gross margins. But I\\'m little cautious about the sequential trends just because in prior years in fact looking back three or four years our Q3 has been a little lower than our Q2. So I think it\\'s important to kind of keep context here. It isn\\'t necessarily a hockey stick in a single direction. We\\'re going to be pulling the LTM numbers up I think for some period of time, but we want to be careful about trying to perform unnatural acts in 90 day periods. You know, in terms of what\\'s driving margin I still think we have and awful lot of room on the operational side, and it\\'s flies to have the price as well and I wish I could tell you a nice tidy sound bite about how much each component is, but of course in every market at each community, is a somewhat different answer. You know, it\\'s clearly the case that feature levels in homes are moving up, and as we change feature levels as we meet customer demand more accurately, I think that\\'s giving us a good margin enhancement opportunity. If we look at the price side, what\\'s really happened for us with prices is a couple of things. The mix of closings has been part of it, but we started raising prices last full and we are now seeing the benefit of that. So I don\\'t think that mix is a huge part of it. One of the metrics I look at is the average house size our average house size I think is up about 100 square feet year-over-year so it isn\\'t a mix change in that sense, but it may be a mix change that the features within the home are creeping up a little bit, and so that\\'s where it gets very difficult to feel how much of it is feature price increase versus base price increase. So I don\\'t know. I probably hit about half your question there, Ivy. IVY ZELMAN: No. I think it\\'s helpful. I think that it would seem as if your conviction should be higher sequentially if there were knows operational improvements and the benefits of things that you have put in place and that you would see more of a hockey stick frankly. You can comment but I will ask my second question first, which would be your community count growth -- obviously we see the challenges of this year, and with all of the benefit from your land bank initiative and further capital spend on more land parcels, can you give us an idea when do you resume to more of the double-digit growth rate with respect to order activity? Where is the inflection point going to come to fruition?. ALLAN MERRILL: It\\'s a great question. Let\\'s talk about community count. So we\\'re at 148 at the end of the quarter, we averaged 150. I think that will trough in Q4 a little bit below 150 and I think we will start to see good community count growth in the first quarter with -- at some points during fiscal 2014 we will clearly get through 170. Exactly the timing of that is challenging and I think -- I want to tie that back to the land spend. I know that the amount of money that we spent in the second quarter was more or less than different people\\'s estimates, but the fact is it\\'s very difficult to just spend the money quickly and wisely and I feel very, very good about the 33 deals that Bob talked about that we have under development, the further 24 that we have contracted for but not yet closed, and then the 11 additional in April, all of which gives us pretty good confidence that this Q3 land spend, over $100 million, is real, and Q4 land spending will be even larger than that. And that\\'s just our money in addition to the GSO money. So I really feel pretty good about the fact that we can drive a community count growth from where it\\'s going to trough a little below 150 above 170, but it\\'s a bit of a fool\\'s errand for me to guess exactly what that mix of community cap growth is going to be quarter by quarter by quarter, but I think all through fiscal 2014, we should see community count growth on a year over year basis. In terms of conviction back on the margin question I feel pretty good about our margins, but I have to say being a little bit of a student of history I mean the fact is for four or five years in a row with Q3 margins at a little bit below Q2, even if we\\'re up materially year over year, we could be flattish to this quarter and I feel very good about that, because the mix by geographies that we tend to see in the third quarter is a little different mix margin-wise than we see in Q2. So I -- I would certainly not want to leave you or anyone else with the impression that we don\\'t have conviction in our ability both operationally and through price to drive margin. We are headed in a single direction. It\\'s just that I think the quarterly comparisons, particularly around a business that\\'s as small as ours is right now, it\\'s a little tricky. And I want to just argue for a bit of caution so folks don\\'t make any linear kind of extrapolations and then feel disappointed. IVY ZELMAN: I understand. Thanks very much. Again, happy birthday. ALLAN MERRILL: Thanks, Ivy. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from David Goldberg with UBS. Your line is open. DAVID GOLDBERG, ANALYST, UBS: Good morning everybody. Nice quarter. And also, happy birthday, Allan. ALLAN MERRILL: Thanks, David. DAVID GOLDBERG: Look, my first question is about the land banking arrangement, and I\\'m trying to get an idea on how you\\'re thinking about the permanency of the land banking arrangement. Is this kind of a bridge to get you guys to the point where you get this group what you need to get back to, you do this for a couple of years, and then you go back to a model where you are controlling more of the land yourself? Or is this kind of a longer term, we think this is parts of the business and a way to defer some of the risk?. ALLAN MERRILL: Yes. Thank you for asking, David, because it\\'s something I wanted to comment on in a more public way since we announced that deal at the end of March, which was really in a period where we were in a quiet period and I couldn\\'t talk much about it. Here\\'s how I think about it. I think there are regulatory issues that may change and, therefore, my view may change, but if we look back on our company or frankly any company in our industry over the last five 10, 15 years, all of us would have your sued some mix of owned assets and rolling-lot option type assets. We know the names of the companies that had more rolling lot options, we know the names of the companies that have less. These are history over a long period of time of being close to 50/50, 60/40, where rolling-lot options were a meaningful part of what the lot supply or the land use was. Well, set aside for a moment the relatively attractiveness of that, and let\\'s deal with the practical reality which is that bank capital to land developers to provide rolling lot options to home builders essentially doesn\\'t exist. I have talked to a lot of land developers in the big markets and they will tell you what the banks are telling them the capital requirements for those kinds of loans, the liquidity reserves for those kinds of loans, the loan losses in the loan books for those kinds of loans, are still too recent. So what I really look at the land bank as is a way to synthetically replace what would have been a portion of our business that was on rolling-lot options. But there are a couple of important improvements, actually. For one thing when you do rolling-lot option deals you can only option those lots that are available. So they pick where they are and we have to figure out a way to make them work. The one nice thing about the land bank is we identify the sites we want to acquire. The other thing, and it\\'s closely related, is that when you\\'re optioning somebody else\\'s lots, you\\'re paying a retail price with some kind of a price inflator on it. When we do a deal in the land bank we\\'re getting that wholesale cost basis, plus a cost of funds, for our partner. And I think when we look at what the effect on our lot costs is comparing the two kind of head-to-head, we\\'re actually pretty happy with where the lot cost is. Now it\\'s clearly higher than if we just owned it on our balance sheet, I think it\\'s somewhat lower than what a traditional rolling-lot option would be. Now, $150 million is a fraction of our total spend over any 12 month time period, and I think time will tell whether or not that facility or others like it become a meaningful part of our land acquisition strategy. But I think, optimistically, and frankly it is my perspective, that it is going to be very difficult for the land developers to get back into the bank market the way they used to. And as a result I think we and others are going to have to use these kinds of strategies we want a portion of our lots available to us other than wholly-owned. So that\\'s kind of how I look at it. I think it\\'s a little bit more permanent and I have seen others trying to guess about the percentage that it might represent. For us right now, options are a relatively small part of our business, even with this $150 million fully deployed, it would be a relatively small percentage of our business. So I don\\'t think it really changes the overall dynamics very much, but I think the margin is very helpful to have that source of capital for and increment of lots other than those that are wholly-owned. DAVID GOLDBERG: Great. Thank you for the color. My follow-up question I imagine you don\\'t want to get too specific on it, but obviously, there\\'s been some personnel changes over the last 12 to 18 months kind of getting the right teams in place, really good quarter this quarter. Do you feel like you have the right people in place now? Do you feel like the teams are right and we\\'re not going to see a lot of changes at the division level? Or do you feel like there\\'s still more to come?. ALLAN MERRILL: We have changed such a high percentage of our divisional leadership I think it\\'s very likely that we will have low turnover at the division level. And when I look at the core markets for us from an investment standpoint, when I talk about California, Texas, Florida, the mid-Atlantic region, I talk about Arizona and North Carolina as sort of in a second tier in terms of incremental capital, we have fantastic teams. In fact, I think one of the things I\\'m most proud of and I think it sets us up well for this improving market, is there are a couple of very big market that we were essentially irrelevant in and not present. That\\'s Dallas and Orlando. And if I look at where we are today because of the leadership teams that we have, the land deals that we have done over the last two years, I mean we\\'re not recognizable to the company that was in those markets two or three years ago. So I think it\\'s the people but I also think it\\'s the land positions that we have taken core markets that are setting us up nicely for the next several years. DAVID GOLDBERG: Thank you. Congrats again. OPERATOR: Next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open. MICHAEL REHAUT, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks. Good morning and nice quarter. First question I had was on gross margins and I guess just to take at it another way -- if you could just remind us as now you\\'re expecting, I guess as you said earlier, community count to trough out later this year and, eventually get to that higher target, with this new communities coming online I guess number one, can you give us a sense of by the time you get to that 170 number what percent of your overall communities would be purchased in the last 18 months? And what type of different margin profile those communities have versus your current mix? Thank you. ALLAN MERRILL: Okay. So that\\'s a complicated questions. That\\'s sort of speculation, and I don\\'t mean that in a pejorative way, but trying to estimate exactly when the existing communities run out which is dependent on a sales basis prospectively so it\\'s a bit tricky. I think if you look at the math, Bob talked about 33, 24 and 11. As 33 communities under construction but not yet open, 24 more and then 11, which gives us what, 67, 68. Those 68 are going to be active, I believe, next year at some point during the year. So just those communities -- forget what we did two and though quarters ago -- are going to represent a meaningful chunk of a number like 170 or greater. So I think that\\'s maybe a context to think about it. I will tell you from an underwriting standpoint with really very few exceptions. In fact, I\\'m not sure I can think of one off the top of my head, we\\'re targeting gross margins above 20% in the new deals that we\\'re buying on current pricing. It\\'s challenging in some places, and in fact I think one of the great lies in our business is well, so and so bought a deal and they\\'re going to settle for lower margins. And I looked at my team and said, \"Hey look, guys we have not stellar margins compared to our peer group. So when we lose a deal it\\'s not because they\\'re dumb and they\\'re going to settle for lower margins. What it really reflects is they were better dialed into what product for the particular buyer profile would maximize the value of that particular piece of dirt.\". And so where we have got to be better and where we\\'ve got to be able to compete is do we have the ability to deliver the product to the buyer that allows us to get that kind of margin. And I feel like, the plan two years ago, the No Community Left Behind, which was, I admit, very hokey but kind of getting the ratio of communities that are performing working, that was an important learning lesson for us about what makes a community tick and how it fix product, and the people, and the promotion, not just the price. So I feel pretty good that that skill set is translating into our land approval process so that we\\'re not having to bid stupidly by accepting low margins to win deals, that we\\'re having to be intelligent -- and I credit our peers for making us smarter to figure out what is it going to take to make a particular deal work and meet our margin targets. So I\\'m not worried that this community count growth has got a bias towards lower margins. MICHAEL REHAUT: No. I mean I certainly wasn\\'t implying that. I was -- I thought implying a positive impact, but just I guess second question this might be more for Bob. From a modeling perspective, the interest expense amortization -- how should that trend through the rest the year? I mean you\\'ve had -- it\\'s been down $3 million, $4 million year over year for the first couple quarters. How should we think about that for 2014? And also any comments on D&A if that should be a kind of keep it at the same run rate, more or less?. BOB SALOMON: Sure. Good morning, Michael. I think that when we talk about cap interest as we continue to add access we\\'re going to continue to capitalize more interest. So the below the line interest obviously will decrease, and the run rate through COGS will probably be similar to what it\\'s been the last couple quarters. I think as we look out. MICHAEL REHAUT: On a dollar basis?. BOB SALOMON: No. On a percentage of revenue basis. Because obviously as you relieve more assets your dollars that go through will be higher. MICHAEL REHAUT: Okay. And then as we look into next year would the percent decline as you build up the inventory?. BOB SALOMON: I think once you get to a point where your, let\\'s call them qualified assets, are equal to your debt, then you\\'re not going to have anything below the line. So then you will kind of shift some of that will you will start to relieve maybe a smaller a little bit higher percentage through COGS on a go-forward basis as you get all of your interest running through cost of sales, because you will get a points where everything that we incur will flow through COGS. MICHAEL REHAUT: Okay. So it would kind of stay more similar on a percentage basis ostensibly in 2014 as you probably won\\'t surpass your debt?. BOB SALOMON: Yes. It\\'s hard to predict when that time will crossover, but certainly once you get to that point in the model then you will probably flip to that a little bit. MICHAEL REHAUT: Okay. Thank you. OPERATOR: Next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. DAN OPPENHEIM, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you talk a little bit more I think there\\'s been enough in terms of the margin questions, you but I guess just thinking about in terms of the sales ahead of expectations and what the community count where it is, it does sort of bring a question are you doing in terms of pushing pricing? And you\\'re pretty clear in terms of talking about the geographic mix of closings is going to be different, and clearly I would expect to see different turnover of the land and margins in Texas versus some of the coastal markets. But I guess trying to think about margins on a same house basis in terms of adjusting for that -- how do you look at that as we go forwards on a sequential basis here? Just trying to understand that in the context of the improvement of the market we\\'re seeing now. ALLAN MERRILL: Yes. And, Dan, good morning. It\\'s such a tricky thing. I mean we spend a lot of time trying to make sure that we can answer these kinds of questions. But really it\\'s so difficult to split because you never really sell exactly the same house twice because the lot is different. There many a lot premium the feature level maybe a bit different. So you start peeling it down and say, \"What was the margin on the Lexington model in this community a year ago? What is it today?\". Well maybe something\\'s changed other than your input costs, and your base price has changed, or your features are higher. So it\\'s tricky. I think the -- so I\\'m not really sure how to give you a numeric hand hold on that. I definitely do not believe that it is just geographic mix driving margin. We are seeing margin improvements in every single division. And so while the mix may accentuate or attenuate that, the fact is every division is seeing improvement in margin. DAN OPPENHEIM: Okay. Thanks. And then I was wondering you talked about bringing on land in Phoenix, and then talked about some land in Sacramento that won\\'t come on for a bit. But is there other land in California that you expect in terms of communities to bring on soon or as you go into fiscal 2014?. ALLAN MERRILL: Yes. I think in that \"land held\" bucket there is other than the $80 million behind or affected by the levee work up in Sacramento, there are some other assets. And I think will have some of those California assets activated in the next several quarters. DAN OPPENHEIM: Great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Next question comes from Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. ADAM RUDIGER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the back half of the year profitability in light of some of your commentary with Ivy\\'s question about not expecting a linear kind of gross margin ramp. If I don\\'t -- at least in the way I model it, if I don\\'t take those gross margins up sequentially, I have a difficult time getting to that back half of the year profitability. So could you tell me what I might be missing maybe or what the other drivers of that might be?. ALLAN MERRILL: Well, sales price is a big one. So you\\'ve got to make sure that you\\'re thinking about that. The number of closings obviously is a big one. I do think as said, we\\'re going to be up nicely year-over-year in each of those quarters. And frankly, it\\'s within the realm of possible that we\\'ll be up sequentially. I just want to be a bit cautious about that because the pattern has not been that we would be sequentially up. I think G&A as a percentage may turn down just a little bit. We have talked about kind of staying in that 9% to 10% range, so I think specific we\\'ve got a bit of room there. But that mix of drivers gives us pretty good confidence in that fourth quarter which allows us, I think, to make the full back half GAAP profitable. ADAM RUDIGER: I guess maybe following up on that then, for the closing price, should we expect -- I\\'m not trying to, I guess I am asking specific items but not trying to -- but should we expect the kinds of ramp we have seen sequentially the last couple of quarters to continue on the average closing price?. ALLAN MERRILL: Here\\'s what I would recommend. Take a look at -- because it\\'s not -- you can do the same thing that I can do, which is look at the relationship between closing ASPs in a quarter and the backlog ASP a quarter and two quarters earlier. And I think if you map that out a little bit, what you will see is the ability to predict within a decent range kind of where closing ASPs ought to be. It\\'s not insignificant that the backlog ASP at $264,000 is $10,000 where it was as a closing ASP this quarter. So but it\\'s not necessarily a next 90 day phenomenon, which is why I\\'m telling you go look one quarterback and two quarters back and sort of roll that and I think that will help you with your pricing modeling. ADAM RUDIGER: Great. The other question I had was one could argue that you guys might have more of a margin versus volume focus than some of your peers as now you have your orders in the desired range although I know you just took the range up and you have different community count trajectory. I was wondering what you in and out that might -- if you thought about that at all the in the context of market share and orders relative to competitors in existing markets. ALLAN MERRILL: Hmm. ADAM RUDIGER: Meaning if you have a greater focus on margins than peers, there might be more or less likely to raise prices as much as you and then you lose some orders. ALLAN MERRILL: Yes. That could happen. I think -- let me just reset back to summer of 2011, and a candid assessment would be that our sales per month per community were last, and our gross margins were last. Two years later our sales per month per community are near the top of the peer group and our gross margins are no longer last but we\\'re not bragging about them. We have still got a lot of room for improvement. And I think that the importance of that sequencing from our perspective was learning how to compete, learning how to make the sale. And having done that and seeing the benefit of that in the absorption rates now, I think that\\'s given us the momentum. It\\'s frankly given us something that is very powerful with home buyers which is sticks in the air. Sticks in the air is the one of the great things working for any builder in terms of driving activity and enthusiasm, creating a sense of urgency, which gives you some pricing power. So I don\\'t think that the rate of improvement in our sales per month per community is going to continue. In fact I said I don\\'t think we\\'ll do another quarter at 3.4. We weren\\'t really trying to do 3.4 this most recent quarter. So yes, we will probably plateau out there a little bit. We could go back a little bit and I would still be very comfortable with where we are with respect to the range that we\\'ve given. We\\'ve got more work to do on the margin side. And to Ivy\\'s question that is both a mix issue, a price issue and it\\'s and operational execution issue. It\\'s just being smarter about what we put in the home and how we merchandise. So I don\\'t know exactly how to put that in the context other builders. You spend more time than I do by far thinking about them, but I would tell you that I feel like getting competitive selling at an aggressive rate gives us the opportunity to now drive margin. I don\\'t think that there are either/ors, I think that they play off of each other. ADAM RUDIGER: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for taking my questions. ALLAN MERRILL: Sure. OPERATOR: Next question comes from Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open. JAY MCCANLESS, ANALYST, STERNE AGEE: Good morning everyone. First question what are the reasons for the big increase in the east segment gross margins on a year-over-year basis?. BOB SALOMON: You know, this is Bob. I think the biggest reason in the east to be honest is we have executed a lot better. We had some issues a year ago, our volumes were lower. And we have improved our teams out there over the last 12 months, and they have executed at a higher rate. And the mix of closings in that east segment have also trended a little bit more towards Maryland and Virginia, which nationally have higher ASPs and higher margins than maybe some of other markets in that segment. But they have operated at a much better rate. JAY MCCANLESS: Second question -- with the almost 400 basis point year over year decline in the cancellation rate, is there any read-through we can make to better availability for first-time buyers in terms of getting finance for a mortgage? Or is it just generally better mortgage availability out there? What can we take away from that?. ALLAN MERRILL: We\\'ve been in a transition over the last year with our Mortgage Choice program where we went from having not a captive but an affiliated relationship, or a marketing relationship with a single lender, to a program now where we\\'ve got lenders literally competing for each prospect in every community. And that list of lenders is small, it\\'s hand-selected, it\\'s based on their ability to service buyers of that profile in that location. And I have to say that I think the lower can rate is largely a function of the fact that those lenders are aggressive, they are working to earn the business of the customer. They\\'re not feeling in any way compelled to try and do business that they don\\'t want to do. So we\\'ve got some lenders that in a particular division are very aggressive for a particular buyer profile in one subdivision, and they\\'re not on our list on another subdivision. And it\\'s a little tougher for us to manage, but it sure gives the our buyer needs and what the buyer wants, I attribute a big part of our can rate reduction to that dynamic. JAY MCCANLESS: Okay. And if I could sneak one more in -- what do you think the mix of entry-level versus move-up customers was this quarter, and where do you expect it to go over the next couple quarters?. ALLAN MERRILL: I don\\'t know how to define those things anymore. You know, first time home buyers are older and wealthier than they ever have been, which is kinds of a part of the legacy of the depression in housing that we\\'ve had. So it\\'s very hard for us to tell the difference between a move up home, or a first time buyer, and a repeat buyer. And there is some consequence to us of not having a mortgage company, because we\\'re not dealing with their individual credit files and so a bit harder to extract that. I don\\'t think we tried to effect a change really in the profile that we\\'ve got. I will tell you that in our two markets where we have historically been an entry-level builder predominantly, the very lowest price points, we have built through those communities over the last two years, and they\\'re simply not replaceable. It\\'s not that we are too good to go and work in that price points, but we can\\'t get the lots to be at that price point. So I think that that\\'s one of the things that\\'s affecting us. But I would say our business is still more heavily weighted to first time buyers, but that definition of a first time buyer has expanded materially over the last couple of years. JAY MCCANLESS: Okay. Great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Next question comes from David Williams with Williams Financial Group. Your line is open. DAVID WILLIAMS, ANALYST, WILLIAMS FINANCIAL GROUP: Thanks so much, and congratulations on a great quarter, guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about the releasing or the activating of the communities out in Arizona and what that means maybe for the other submarkets and maybe -- are you beginning to take a closer look at some of the second-tier markets today thinking about where that transition is? Are you seeing anything in terms of buyers that are more willing today maybe move out away from those city centers or maybe into those second-tier markets? Just kind of your general thoughts there. ALLAN MERRILL: Well, the asset that we activated in Phoenix and the submarket that we\\'re in is one that we have consistently been in. But the fact of the matter was over the last three or four years, we could buy distressed finished lots more cheaply than we could develop that land held asset. Market conditions have changed, finished lots at distressed prices or otherwise have been absorbed. And so that asset is still in the right location but it is now economically pretty attractive. It requires land development dollars. Two or three years ago, if we could buy a finished lot at a lower all-in costs than what it would have been to develop those lots, I think we did the economically rational thing. But it\\'s not so much that the location of the piece of dirt changed. That piece of dirt in relation to what other opportunities existed -- that\\'s what\\'s changed. Does that make sense?. DAVID WILLIAMS: It does. Thanks so much for the color there. And then secondly what are you seeing in terms of cycle times and how those are holding up, thinking about the labor constraints during the market today? And are you seeing anything maybe on the development side as well as far as cycle times and how long it\\'s take to go bring some of that land to market?. ALLAN MERRILL: Well, I don\\'t want to jinx this on the land development side so I will say I\\'m very weary of that. So far we haven\\'t seen too much of an effect there. We\\'ve got some bigger deals and some more land development dollars over the next six months. So I will just predict now in advance of it happening we will have a few challenges there as others are ramping up their community counts as well but we haven\\'t really seen it yet. On the construction side, there are clearly labor peaks and valleys and those availability peaks and valleys can affect cycle time. I think in the bigger markets in the Southwest in particular, we have seen a week, ten days in -- at certain times of the year where we have had some cycle time expansion. I will say that that\\'s after a concerted effort over the last two years to quite dramatically reduce cycle time. So we are still a lot better than we were even two years ago. But it\\'s definitely widened out in a market like Phoenix or Las Vegas in the last five or six months. DAVID WILLIAMS: Great. And one more if I could. Could you kind of quantify the incentives this quarter, and then maybe how the input costs were up, maybe on a square foot basis?. ALLAN MERRILL: I don\\'t have the incentive number at my fingertips, so I can\\'t do that for you. I will tell you that they were down both sequentially and year-over-year. One of the big factors in our quarter, in the March quarter, is always February. Well, the reason it\\'s a big factor is that for the last six years, we have been running and annual sales event in February. And I can tell you 2006 through 2012, that was a period where we sold a lot of homes but there was a significant amount of discounting. Initially it was moving that view finished specs, and frankly at the very trough of the market it was allowing us to recover our basis and land really more than profit from the home sales. That was really different this year. So February for us was not a discounting opportunity. It was and enthusiasm and an urgency opportunity -- get the last lot on the lake, get the first lot against the open space, be the first owner of the new two story master down, those kinds of things as opposed to trying to discount. So I just know that our discounts and incentives are materially lower. We\\'ve also, through our CMA process, gotten I think a bit smarter. I think we were a bit lazy about high prices and big incentives. On a net basis we were okay. That\\'s a pretty bad way to compete And those gaps get very large, the incentives get very large, it undermines buyer confidence. So I think we\\'ve tightened up pricing over the last year as we\\'ve really used our CMA process, where we probably brought a lot of base prices down but then more than offset that we reductions in incentives. So hopefully that gives you a little color. I\\'m sorry I can\\'t be very authoritative on the percentage or the dollars. I just know it\\'s less. I think on the build costs -- well, Bob can talk a little bit that. I think he\\'s done some work on it. BOB SALOMON: I think there certainly has been some increases in materials and labor. Everybody knows that lumber has been up quite significantly over the last six months. We have seen increases in drywall and concrete and the labor associated with framing and drywall and plumbing. However, I think that the throughput rate as you can see by the margins that have risen is we\\'ve been able to capture that and then some with the lowering of incentives and increasing our house prices. ALLAN MERRILL: In our builds, we have seen a several dollar per square foot increase, but the challenge with that is the features have changed. And so the build costs are higher, but it\\'s not apples-to-apples. So a couple bucks a foot I would say you would have a good guess of the net effect. But it is kind of a guess because even if the category level, if you\\'re building a bonus room for somebody as an example your lumber package is higher. Well is your lumber package higher because it\\'s more 2x4s or is your lumber package higher because each 2x4 was more. And at a point polling that out house by house becomes challenging. That\\'s why I say it\\'s that several dollars per square foot, it\\'s probably more on the order of $2 that really is associated just with material and labor increases. DAVID WILLIAMS: Great. Thanks so much. OPERATOR: Our last question comes from Joel Locker with FBN Securities. Your line is open. JOEL LOCKER, ANALYST, FBN SECURITIES: Hi, guys. Nice quarter. Just basically I wanted to check in on your backlog conversion rates. This I guess your finished specs being only about 5% of your back log is the lowest number possible or lowest number by a long shot in a while and just going forward if you look at the third and fourth quarter if that dynamic is going to slow backlog conversion a little bit?. ALLAN MERRILL: I think what we said, Joel, in November is that we thought our backlog conversion rates would mirror pretty reasonably with what we converted in fiscal 2012. And I still believe that, and I think we\\'ve been pretty close to those numbers the first two quarters. We\\'ve got a much lower spec count today than we had even a year ago. Our to-be-built homes in backlog are about 80% so I continue to think that we will be pretty close to what last year\\'s conversion rates were. And I can tell you that Q3 of fiscal 2012 was about 56%. We\\'re about 66% in the fourth quarter a year ago. JOEL LOCKER: Right. Alright. And then also on your -- just about California, if you were looking to maybe strategically diversify because some of your land is weighted in certain areas versus maybe sell pieces to other builders because the land price has gone up and maybe redeploy that asset to take some I guess risk offer the table and maybe diversify in other parts of California if that was a point?. ALLAN MERRILL: Well, positions where we are actively building right now, I like a lot. We\\'re very active in that I-10 corridor east of LA, and we\\'ve got a number of communities in that area really starting in as close as Fullerton and then going out I-10. And the things that we\\'ve got there, and we have some land-held assets that are in comparable submarkets. I think those are going to be excellent positions for us in the years ahead. So I\\'m not overwhelmed about changing anything there. I think up north we\\'ll keep our eye on the levee situation. Obviously it\\'s very difficult to predict when that will be fully appropriated and constructed, and we will have to make a decision about that market. We happen to own what I believe is among the very best parcels else in Sacramento. We\\'re at two of the four possible interchanges or quadrants at one of the busiest freeway intersections in the state. They\\'re very significant positions. They\\'re very valuable positions. We\\'ll make a decision about what to do with them when we\\'re a little closer to being able to put them into production. JOEL LOCKER: Right. And then what about the land in Temecula? I know you\\'ve got a large piece there. I was just wondering if you --. ALLAN MERRILL: Yes. We like that Temecula corridor. I mean, gosh, it\\'s amazing what\\'s happened to land prices down there. I saw something a couple of weeks ago when I was out there. An investor had paid X and had just laid them off at 3.5 times X in relatively short order. It made me feel very good about our French Valley, we call it French Valley, our French Valley assemblage. JOEL LOCKER: Right. All right, thanks a lot guys. ALLAN MERRILL: Okay. Well, I think that was the last question. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you in about 90 days. OPERATOR: Thank you for joining today\\'s conference call.

Presentation OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to today\\'s Golar LNG Limited Second Quarter 2020 Results Presentation. (Operator Instructions) I also must advise you, this conference is being recorded today, 13th of August 2020. I now hand you over to your first speaker, Iain Ross. IAIN ROSS, CEO, GOLAR LNG LIMITED: Thank you, operator. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Golar LNG Q2 2020 Results Presentation. My name is Iain Ross, and I\\'m the CEO of Golar LNG. Today, I\\'m joined on the line by CFO Callum Mitchell-Thomson; and Stuart Buchanan, Head of Investor Relations. We\\'re also pleased to have Eduardo Maranho, CFO of Golar Power, on the line to participate in today\\'s call. I\\'d like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statement on Slide 1. And if we turn to Slide 4, let me give you some highlights before Callum takes us through the numbers in more detail. Today, we report an adjusted EBITDA of $67 million on revenue of $102 million for the quarter, which is driven by a further solid FLNG performance and better seasonal results in shipping. And again, we commend the effort of our whole team in keeping the business running remotely and to our offices and ratings on board who\\'ve coped with longer work cycles than normal and dealing with all sorts of restrictions and constraints in doing their jobs. And I am pleased to report further improvements in our ability to crew change, with most of our people now having been changed there. In shipping, our time charter earnings of $45,000 per day for Q2 represents an 88% rise over the same period last year. We continue to derisk our shipping portfolio and ended the quarter with a shipping revenue backlog of $105 million. Our FLNG operations maintained 100% commercial uptime through the quarter, with a further 6% reduction in operating costs compared to the first quarter and stable EBITDA generation. And in downstream, Golar Power received full capacity payments on Sergipe and Nanook, with Golar\\'s share of that equating to $19 million of revenue, less operating costs. The small-scale rollout was boosted by the signing of a partnership with Galileo, and the MOU signing with Norsk Hydro for the provision of LNG and regas capacity into the Alunorte Alumina refinery in Brazil will reduce the refinery\\'s CO2 output by some 600,000 tons per year. That\\'s equivalent of the carbon capture of around 10 million tree seedlings planted and grown for 10 years. It\\'s a great ESG story. More details on these segments later. Let me now hand over to Callum to take you through the numbers. CALLUM MITCHELL-THOMSON, CFO, GOLAR LNG LIMITED: Well, thank you, Iain. Good morning, everybody. If you turn to Page 5, the second quarter 2020 financial results are shown in more detail here. Iain mentioned the $103 million of operating revenue. You can see that in the blue column. That is a 14% beat on the consensus $90 million for the quarter and is achieved with the stability of the $55 million of FLNG, as Iain mentioned. Given Hilli\\'s stability, that is a very stable a and well-performing asset. And then secondly, $48 million of operating revenues from shipping and corporate, which is down due to the typical seasonality that Iain referred to in TCE rates but is an improvement over Q2 in 2019. That change is largely driven by the reduction in TCE rates, partly offset by some additional improvements on vessel management, which I\\'ll go to in a second. That produced a net loss for the quarter of $156 million. That net loss is largely driven by the $135.9 million impairment that we took on our shares in Golar Partners. If you remember, we own approximately 33% of that business, and U.S. GAAP requires us that at the point that we feel a drop in the stock price as anything other than temporary, then we need to take that impairment. We\\'ve written the business down to the current market level, which is again a U.S. GAAP requirement and something we\\'re happy to do. That revenue performance of $103 million generated the adjusted EBITDA of $67 million that Alex -- that Iain referred to. That in itself is a 23% beat versus NASDAQ EBITDA consensus for the period, and that 23% beat is based off the 14% improved beat on revenues, plus some cost-cutting that we\\'ve managed to achieve that I\\'ll go through on the next slide in a second. That $67 million is broken down by the $41 million out of FLNG, again stable over the quarters, the stability that Iain referred to, plus $32 million from shipping, which is down due to the seasonality on Q1 but is an improvement on the same quarter Q2 2019. Final point to note on this page is our cash position. I think we\\'ve committed to you at the start of quarter 1 to manage -- during quarter 1 to manage the cash position and to preserve liquidity in keeping with many companies in the COVID-19 crisis. And we\\'re pleased to see and we\\'re pleased to show that broadly speaking, our cash position is stable, and that has largely been achieved back to the cash generation in the business, plus the refinancings that we\\'ve managed to achieve, one of which are ahead of schedule, which we will go into in more detail in a second. So adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, a 23% beat on consensus; stability in FLNG and seasonality in shipping, partially offset by cost cutting. If you turn the page to Page 6, adjusted EBITDA development over the last 12 months, you\\'ll see the variation on the quarter Q1 on the left-hand side. We referred to the reduction in TCE rates down to the $45,000, and that is -- the impact of that is set out on a -- you can see in red of the $20 million or so. And then working your way down the page, you will see the decrease in expenses that I referred to, to get us back to partially offset that seasonality. It\\'s important to note that, that expense reduction is a function of 2 factors. The first is some good work by the team in terms of cutting expenses, but it also relates to the impact of COVID-19 as with many other businesses. So we\\'re still working our way through how much of -- once were the global pandemic to ease in business to return more to normal, how much of expenses will come back. So you should not see all of that expense reduction as being a reduction in through-cycle run rate but partially so. It\\'s also important to note on the right-hand side of this page that our LTM adjusted EBITDA is broadly stable over the past 12 months. If you now -- I promised to talk about cash and liquidity in more detail. If you turn your attention to the next page, Page 7, liquidity development for 2020. The bars on the top replay to you what happened in Q1. You\\'ll remember from Q1, our cash balance at the end of 31st of March was $235 million. That is shown in gray in the middle of the page. And then the movements from that going forward to the 30th of June, the $225 million balance that we currently have is set out. Effectively, operating cash flow positive, less than in Q1 reflecting the seasonality we\\'ve just discussed, partially offset by some CapEx. Debt service is stable, some other movements, and then the Bear refinancing. We\\'ve committed in Q1 that by Q3, we would refinance 3 vessels, and we\\'ve achieved the Bear early. That is a refinancing that\\'s given us $40 million of additional liquidity gross, which as you\\'ll see in the bullets below is effectively $38 million of unrestricted cash. The reconciliation between the 2 is set out later, but broadly speaking, there is some of the debt service associated with the Bear included in the $80 million debt that is shown on the bar chart. What\\'s the outlook for the rest of the year? There\\'s no real change given what we said in Q1, again reflecting our plans and stability. We\\'re in the process of refinancing the $150 million bilateral loan, which is due in November 20, and the $30 million outstanding margin loan due August/September 20. We had committed to put in place a revolving credit facility with a number of banks. Discussions there are very well advanced and positive. And while we\\'re not finished, we had said that we would aim to have that done in Q3. And we feel that, that is very much on track. In addition, we\\'ve had 2 routine refinances, which we\\'ve committed to, the Frost which -- and the Seal. The Seal will not generate any additional liquidity. That as we\\'ve said previously, is just a removal of the put option that will occur in January next year. And the Frost will generate additional liquidity. And with that vessel, I feel we have term sheets broadly agreed but are working our way through due diligence and other items with the lenders. Naturally, that refinancing is obviously subject to market conditions, but as we see it today, we feel broadly positive about that. Again, we\\'re comfortable and happy to repeat the last bullet point on the page that we mentioned in the previous results, where we said based on achieving these now 3, previously it was four for the refinancing, we feel between that, the anticipated CapEx, debt savings and operating cash flow, we feel that is sufficient for our needs for the remainder of 2020. Again, no real change. So stable cash balances, and the Bear refinancing achieved one quarter early. With that, let me turn you back to Iain to take you through shipping in more detail. IAIN ROSS: Thanks, Callum. If we turn to Slide 9 and shipping, the second quarter saw a continued decline in TFDE spot rates to around about $30,000 a day for much of the period before starting a slow recovery post quarter. These lower rates resulted from a combination of seasonal LNG demand decline and lower overall global economic activity resulting from the COVID pandemic. For the U.S., cancellations kept ton miles low during the quarter, but we still expect a degree of slow steaming and storage to emerge towards the end of the year, boosting rates over the northern winter before overall volumes pick up again in 2021. Our shipping strategy continues to contribute well towards our TCE protecting the downside through the shoulder season, which is clearly illustrated in the graph on Slide 9. If you compare the last 3 quarters, so Q4 \\'19 through to Q2 \\'20 with the prior corresponding 12-month quarters Q4 \\'18 through to Q2 \\'19, we\\'re generating significantly more adjusted EBITDA, and that\\'s largely driven through the commercial shipping strategy and associated increased utilization of the fleet. On Slide 10, you can see we\\'ve offset some of that seasonal decline in rates through decreased costs, as Callum showed you, albeit that some of these operating cost reductions will be incurred later in the year as we implement some deferred maintenance. But we have implemented permanent cost reductions, and we\\'ll continue to seek more. Despite the burn of the backlog during the quarter, our backlog remains very strong compared to 12 months ago. And you can see that in the picture on the right-hand side with around half of the backlog on fixed rates and the other half on some form of market-related or floating-rate structure. We\\'re focusing on building backlog and managing our costs. And at this stage, we expect Q3 TCE to be around $35,000 per day. Whilst these lower LNG prices are not great for the current shipping market, we believe that lower LNG prices will continue to stimulate LNG demand as an alternative and cleaner fuel compared to coal and other more polluting fossil fuels. Lower pricing of LNG now will accelerate the use of LNG as a transition fuel for the next 10-plus years, leading to increased demand for liquefaction. The LNG producers will be looking to develop liquefaction projects at a lower cost. And with an associated increase in LNG volumes being produced, this will in turn lead to increase demand for shipping in the future. Golar is unique outside the oil and gas majors and NOCs in participating in both the midstream production of LNG and the downstream distribution of LNG to local gas and electricity customers. Turning now to the production of LNG, in our case FLNG, on Slide 12. Our FLNG unit Hilli Episeyo offshore Cameroon has delivered another steady performance in quarterly earnings, as Callum explained. We\\'ve offloaded 42 cargoes, maintaining 100% commercial uptime and have produced over 2.5 million tons of LNG since the unit came on stream in 2018. We continue to have an ongoing dialogue with Perenco, our customer, on the potential for increased throughput on Hilli, but nothing further to report this quarter in terms of concrete agreements. And we continue to receive incoming interest for the use of Hilli post the Perenco contract that runs for the next 6 years. Turning to Slide 13. As previously advised, BP, a customer for the 20-year FLNG Gimi lease, an operating agreement, sent Golar with an FM delay notice as a result of the COVID pandemic and has subsequently maintained its claimed estimate of that delay as being around 12 months. Unchanged over the last quarter has been the impact of the Singapore circuit breaker as the country\\'s COVID-19 response is known and the extent to which that shutdown has temporarily impacted the Keppel Shipyard, our contractor in Singapore. The yard effectively reopened last month, and Keppel is now ramping up the workforce in compliance with the government restrictions with around 500 workers currently back on the project in accordance with the restart plan. So my 3 brief points to make up Gimi this quarter are: firstly, we continue to be in active and constructive discussion with BP, our partners, our financiers and our contractors on the matter; secondly, the rescheduled program that takes into account the delays caused by the Singapore shutdown; and thirdly, whilst not finalized, we anticipate satisfactory closure on this in due course, and we don\\'t expect to have a material increase in the total project budget. And the overall delay in the project of around 12 months, driven by BP\\'s time line, will correspondingly improve our near-term cash flow through delayed equity injections into the project. And I hope you\\'ll understand that specific details of these discussions do remain confidential at this time. Briefly on the Viking FSRU Conversion project, the project team and contractors are working hard to mitigate any COVID-related challenges. We are now planning for the vessel to depart from China to Europe late September, with vessel delivery upon commissioning and completion by the year-end according to the original plan. And on the FLNG pipeline, we\\'ve extended our collaboration agreement with one IOC to explore applications for FLNG in their portfolio. And our Mark III newbuild continues to make progress in both refining the design and identifying real deployment opportunities. We believe that our simple process configuration, combined with a \"design one, build many\" mindset will serve to keep costs down, schedules short and payment terms achievable. And importantly, we also believe that our energy management system delivers a superior efficiency compared to many onshore facilities, resulting in competitively low carbon emissions on a like-for-like basis. Turning now to downstream and Golar Power\\'s progress over the quarter. In terms of development, progress was made on a number of fronts, which we can see on Slide 15 with further details on Slide 16. The signing of an MOU with Norsk Hydro will involve Golar Power delivering gas to the Alunorte Alumina refinery in Barcarena. This is a fantastic example of Golar Power bringing a cost-effective solution to a customer that will not only pay less money for fuel but will significantly improve its CO2 emissions. This commercial customer, together with the previously discussed 605-megawatt PPA award, underpins Golar Power\\'s investment in the FSRU terminal at Barcarena with FID anticipated around the end of the year. The terminal will then be a subsequent foundation for the rollout of small-scale distribution across the State of Par. An FID for the Par station is anticipated in the middle of next year. The signing of an agreement with Galileo, and Galileo is a producer of both land-based gas and biomethane from landfills, will accelerate the development of the small-scale rollout in the Brazilian states of Bahia and So Paulo with operations expected to commence later this year. This agreement links in nicely with the development of the previously announced partnership agreement with BR and that we can biomethane-sourced LNG to distribute as a fuel through the BR network across Brazil in addition to the previously described sources from our terminals and FSRUs. The permitting process continues for an FSU to be located at a new terminal at Suape in Northeast Brazil. The first ISO containers have been delivered into the region, and the terminal FID is expected around the year. Key regulatory and environmental licenses have been obtained for the Santa Catarina terminal, and development planning on that continues to progress. And as we continue to look at a number of international locations that may be suitable to replicate this model currently, we\\'re currently examining 15 separate opportunities to internationalize the business. So some more detail in the small-scale rollout on Slide 17. The volumes available for small-scale distribution can be seen in the graph on the bottom left side of the slide, with the step increase in the size of the gray column in 2022. That\\'s reflecting the increased volumes available for distribution once the Barcarena FSRU\\'s in place. With the power stations and also in the case of Barcarena Alunorte deal, underpinning the development of the terminal and a commitment to the FSRU, I think this graph illustrates the upside potential of these vessels really well, turning volumes into dollars. And if we manage to sell half of the spare capacity of these FSRUs and get a margin of, say, $0.50 per MMBTU, that would equate to additional profit of $150 million in 2022. As a reminder, excess FSRU capacity that we can have -- that we have can be utilized for 3 things. One, power plant expansions in merchant power in Sergipe is a good example, and I\\'ll talk a little bit more about that in a sec. Gas marketing, so the sale of natural gas to third parties, Norsk Hydro and Alunorte is an example of that. And then the third is breaking bulk into small scale, as we\\'ve discussed before. So that\\'s using the FSRU as a vessel for LNG storage. We take the gas out as LNG and not as regasified meter. We continue to make progress on converting expressions of interest on the small-scale line in committed contracts with a further 2 executed in the quarter and 2 more in the third quarter so far. On Slide 18 and just detailing our the merchant power opportunity at Sergipe in similar detail. The graph on the left-hand side of the slide shows the electricity spot prices in reais per megawatt hour from December 2016 to the end of 2019. And it clearly shows the seasonality during each year, and that\\'s driven by a combination of demand and rainfall, and the rainfall determines whether the hydro baseload is adequate or whether the fossil fuel plants need to be called to dispatch. And overlaid on that are 2 lines. The top line, the blue one, is Sergipe dispatch breakeven cost. And that line implies that in theory, the plant can be called to dispatch whenever the prevailing spot price is above that line. And the lower green line represents the merchant breakeven cost of running the plant independently from the PPA. The purchase price of LNG influences the position of this line. And here, we have it with an LNG purchase price of $3 per MMBTU, which is conservatively high against today\\'s prices. The team at Golar Power run a back test of the opportunistic merchant power income that could have been made based on the available merchant dispatch windows over the last 3 years, and this analysis shows that Golar\\'s share of that additional profit could have been around $70 million. That\\'s the Golar LNG share. This translates to around $16 million to $18 million net profit for burning a full cargo of Nanook over a 2- week period, and remember that we\\'ve got 60 days notice for any dispatch under the PPA. I mentioned at the start, we\\'ve got Eduardo on the call today as I know there an increasing amount of -- there\\'s an increasing amount of interest in Golar Power development story, and he\\'s there to answer some questions. We turn now to Slide 20, highlighting some of our ESG projects, which cover our 5 focus areas and include safety and management engagement campaigns on both the vessels and active engagement with engine manufacturers; to understand key drivers of methane slip, what we can do about improving performance; mental health support of our people, especially as a result of COVID-19. On the right-hand side of the slide, there\\'s some pictures showing the results of placing a Golar-designed hydropower turbine into the flow from the seawater discharge in the regas system and using that to generate energy to power the system. This simple design provides the FSRU with a 7% saving in fuel efficiency, and importantly an estimated saving of 5,000 tons of CO2 per year. So just some examples of what we\\'re doing in the space of ESG. So summarizing our priorities on Slide 22 (sic) [Slide 22]. We will continue to derisk shipping and focus on backlog growth. In FLNG, our focus is to conclude the position on Gimi and continue to progress discussions for potential expansion and extension of Hilli, and of course the development of the newbuild Mark III and future opportunities. In downstream, we\\'ll continue to push a build-out of small-scale and develop the terminals at Barcarena and Suape. We\\'ll focus on concluding the refinancing activities that Callum discussed, and of course, we\\'ll continue to push for a sustainable reduction in G&A and simplification of the Golar group structure. With that, I\\'d like to hand you back to the operator for Q&A. Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Randy Giveans. (technical difficulty) I think -- I\\'m not sure he disconnected, but we\\'ll just take the next question. It\\'s coming from Jon Chappell. JONATHAN B. CHAPPELL, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Iain, first one for you is strategic. So the press release says the strategic review has been concluded. The Board\\'s approved a range of specific options. But if I look at this last slide you had, it seems like every kind of near-term priority is maybe blocking and tackling within the silo. So as we think about maybe the imminent breakup of the company and the 3 different business lines, which do you view as kind of stand-alone at this point with the ability to kind of self-finance themselves? And which may be need to be together as in their different stages of the evolution? IAIN ROSS: I\\'ll let Callum comment in a second, but rather than commenting specifically on your question, I\\'d really refer you to the overall strategic plan. So the GLNG Board has approved the examination of a range of strategic options management that we\\'re now developing. And as these strategic options mature and potentially become actionable, we\\'re going to take them back to the Board for consideration. And if approved for execution, we\\'ll announce something at that time. But Callum, do you want to add any more color on -- for Jon? CALLUM MITCHELL-THOMSON: Yes. Sure. I mean Jon, your point about blocking and tackling is right. That\\'s what we\\'re -- we have 2 jobs. We have the blocking and tackling, which we can set out in real detail, which we\\'ve done, which is what we\\'re doing and what you can expect from us. That\\'s very different from the strategic review and the structure of the group. So that\\'s why it\\'s not on the page. The other reason why it\\'s not on page is if you remember from Q1, I think we\\'ve got broad alignment from the group that they were -- got approval from the Board to target the 4 legs: FSRU, FLNG, shipping and Golar Power and to simplify and put the group into those 4 legs and ensure that each one of them was stand-alone. So that\\'s what we got Board approval for. We then went being back to the Board in this quarter to say here are the routes to achieve that. So not the destination, but the journey together, here are the steps we think we need to take to implement that. And we gave the Board a range of options, which we referred to in the press release. And the Board has selected some for us to then put in more detail to see if we can get them across the line to execute them, and that\\'s what we\\'re doing. And once we\\'ve reached that point where we think they\\'re executable, we would go back to the Board to say, \"Here\\'s what we\\'ve done. Do you approve?\" And then we\\'d be in a position to make an announcement. And then I go back to your question, there are 2 bits in your question. One was a sort of -- I think there was an assumption in your question, which I think probably takes us a step too far, which is as you said as you think about the imminent breakup of the group. I don\\'t think we don\\'t see it as neither imminent nor a full breakup of the group. So let me sort of pick you up on that if I might. I mean the broad picture of 4 stand-alone legs is where we\\'re going. And then secondly, to your question about stand-alone financing and which does one we see as being more or less mature, I think everybody would say that the shipping business is a business that is seeing some seasonality right now. It\\'s perhaps not as poor as -- it\\'s not been the same seasonality that one had in previous years. I think you\\'ve seen that in the results of our sales and others. But certainly, the shipping business is one of the ones where that is probably less on the spectrum of financing. Whereas pick any one of the other businesses, they\\'re probably equally stand-alone. So hopefully -- there was a lot in your question, but hopefully that\\'s covered it. JONATHAN B. CHAPPELL: Yes, super helpful. So procedural approval, maybe not execution approval. So on the follow-up then, clearly, you spent a lot of time, you made a lot of headway in Brazil. And maybe not quite a success story yet, but clearly a path towards that. The interesting commentary about replicating it in other regions. I guess the question there is, without even naming regions, are the opportunity sets similar? And are there economies of scale in the procedures that you\\'ve taken to penetrate the Brazilian market that you could be much quicker to market from kind of start to finish in some of these other regions you\\'re contemplating? IAIN ROSS: I think that\\'s a great question for Eduardo. EDUARDO MARANHAO, CFO OF GOLAR POWER, GOLAR LNG LIMITED: Yes, sure, Jon. Nice to meet you and happy to answer that one. So I think when we look at our global ambitions for Golar Power, we definitely will try to replicate what we have been doing in Brazil, and we really see Brazil as a stepping stone for our global business plan. I think one of the key fundamental strategies of our development will be to try to partner with experienced local players, such as the ones that we have identified in Brazil in the case of Sergipe, in the case of our small-scale LNG distribution partnership with BR. So we are actively discussing with a number of potential partners in some other geographies. If I were to highlight just a few key areas, I would say Southeast Asia is definitely one region that we definitely see as a potential area for development of our strategy as well as some other countries in West Africa as well as in other countries in Latin America. I think those are the areas which we believe we have a very strong position as of today. OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan. BENJAMIN JOEL NOLAN, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. And maybe I\\'ll -- Eduardo, I\\'ll follow with you. Obviously, I think as Jon mentioned, a lot going on with Golar Power at the moment. And what I\\'m hoping that you might be able to do is just maybe put a bow on it a little bit or take all of those moving pieces and codify them into a few simple numbers, specifically sort of based on what you have line of sight on and including a lot of the smaller things. How much is sort of the CapEx requirement going forward? And then also again, maybe not even including any merchant power but sort of as you do include a lot of the smaller scale and incremental developments, what do you see as sort of the potential for cash flow generation on an annual basis out of, let\\'s say, Brazil specifically but that being a proxy for Golar Power in general? EDUARDO MARANHAO: Okay, Ben. I think when we look at the future developments of our future projects, I think it\\'s important to highlight the fact that we are yet to take FID on certain projects, so those detailed CapEx figures as well as the full EBITDA projection will be announced by that point in time. But what we can say is that the ability to generate, for example, merchant power will not require any further incremental CapEx from what we have in place today. So the Golar network is fully connected to the power plant, which is able to generate power during the times of the year when it\\'s not generating under the PPA. So this is definitely something that is incremental whenever we are able to run the plant. Another important point is with regards to the small-scale strategy, which is highly modular in a way that the CapEx will be proportionate to the number of contracts that we\\'re able to secure. So we are not going to go speculative, spend a substantial amount of money without having the corresponding contracts fixed. So I think that, that growth goes hand in hand with the commercial development with regards to the contract -- the offtake contracts that we\\'re able to secure. When we look at Barcarena, I think we have announced the MOU with Norsk Hydro, which is a very important milestone towards our FID, which we believe we\\'ll be in a position to take a final investment decision in the next 4 to 6 months. So I would say that with regards to the future CapEx plans, they will be more detailed in the future as soon as we take a fund investment decision on those projects. BENJAMIN JOEL NOLAN: Okay. All right. And I\\'ll leave it at that, I guess. But another thing that -- maybe jumping over, I guess, from my second question over to the FLNG side. Obviously, it\\'s been pretty slow going for a while. I\\'m curious, firs of all, if there\\'s been any change in the pace of conversations, maybe also I know that you were selected as one of the potential participants for a possible deal in the Mediterranean and Chevron moving in there, whether anything has happened with that. But maybe just a little bit more of a sort of a pace of progress with respect to conversations and discussions on the technology side. IAIN ROSS: So Ben, I\\'d describe the pace of conversations is steady. So it hasn\\'t disappeared, and it hasn\\'t really accelerated. And I think that\\'s to be expected with all the turmoil in the world that\\'s going on. And I think it\\'s a good thing that despite the fact that we\\'ve got low LNG prices, we\\'re still having active dialogues with potential customers. As I mentioned, we had one arrangement with one of the bigger IOCs that expired, and they\\'ve asked to extend that for another year to continue looking at possible applications of our technology to their development. So I think it\\'s there. And as I\\'ve said many times before in the call, as the supply/demand lines cross in the future and more LNG needs to be built out, we believe we\\'ll be at the front of the queue because we are the cheapest and fastest liquefaction projects that can get to market. And we don\\'t have any of the issues that onshore-based facilities have around land, taking on land and dealing with local labor issues and all that kind of stuff. So we think we\\'re super competitive. And I\\'m very pleased with the development in the Mark III work that\\'s being done because that\\'s ending up at this stage to look like it\\'s as competitive in dollars per ton as the Mark I, the smaller facilities, and we can do up to 5 million tons in those vessels. So really looking forward to continuing the discussions with potential customers on that. BENJAMIN JOEL NOLAN: Okay. And on the Mediterranean side? IAIN ROSS: No, nothing\\'s changed. You\\'ve said -- you seen the news. I mean I don\\'t expect anything will happen to that deal with Chevron closes. I wouldn\\'t imagine any movement, and that will happen, but it\\'s really something to ask Noble. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of randy Giveans. RANDALL GIVEANS, VP,SENIOR ANALYST & GROUP HEAD OF ENERGY MARITIME SHIPPING, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sorry, my call dropped earlier. I think Chappell cut my phone line back here. Now first, congrats obviously on the Golar Bear refinancing. Doing what you said you were going to do there is good. Now what is the LTV of that 120 million sale-leaseback? And what are the terms of the financing? And I guess following that, if you plan on dropping your debt into each entity, what happens with the converts? CALLUM MITCHELL-THOMSON: Good question. So it\\'s not -- we don\\'t want to disclose publicly what the LTV is on the Bear so -- nor the terms. You can think of the terms as being broadly similar to previous financing, maybe a touch longer in -- maybe a bit longer in duration. So when we look at it, we think it\\'s commercially attractive business for us because it both increases leverage but -- increase in good liquidity but increases duration. So we think that is good. I\\'m sorry that I\\'m going not going to answer your LTV question, but that\\'s sort of -- that\\'s reasonably market sensitive, and it\\'s dependent on each blender. To your question about the restructuring of the business and putting the businesses on a stand-alone basis, yes, we do. Yes, we do want to do that. But that in -- on a through-cycle basis, we\\'ll still generate free cash flow to equity up to the group. And one of the things that we feel confident about is that by having these 4 legs, it increases our financing -- financial flexibility to match, as we\\'ve discussed in the past, investor appetite, risk/return risk/return profile with the risk/return profile of the different businesses. And that\\'s something that\\'s very important to us, and I think it\\'s important to our investors as well. So I\\'ve slightly not answered your question on what are our plans for the converts because we will announce anything when we to have something to announce. And when I\\'ve been asked about -- when we\\'ve been asked about converts in the past, we\\'ve said, yes, there\\'s a clear -- given the state of the convert market, there is a clear and sensible refinancing for ALM route for the converts, but we\\'re prioritizing liquidity at the moment. And that\\'s sort of commitment we\\'ve made, and that\\'s one of the reasons why our cash flows is steady. So forgive me for not giving you all the detail, but I hope you can see how we think of it at least. RANDALL GIVEANS: Sure. No, that\\'s understandable. So it sounds like you don\\'t necessarily have to refinance the convert if you do silo the other debt into the other entities. But I guess... CALLUM MITCHELL-THOMSON: No, no. I guess... RANDALL GIVEANS: Yes, and that\\'s fair. All right, second question, turning to Golar Power and those contracts and the MOUs. I guess what specific hurdles are maybe required to convert some of those contracts and take that positive Barcarena FID in the next, I think you said, 4 to 6 months in the release? IAIN ROSS: Sure. Eduardo, would you like to comment? EDUARDO MARANHAO: Yes, sure. Randy, I\\'m happy to answer that one. So I think the final investment decision of Barcarena is not necessarily linked to the rollout of the small-scale contracts. I think they do in some way they are complementary in their strategy, but we view them as a separate kind of a business development. So I think Barcarena, it\\'s much more a matter of progressing with the required permits and regulatory approvals to be in a position to take a final investment decision. We have been awarded the PPA back in the power auction that took place in October last year. And now with the recently announced MOU with Norsk Hydro, we believe that once all those permits and approvals are met, we will be in a position to take FID for Barcarena. When it comes for the small-scale contracts, I think as you can see, there are a number of contracts and discussions being taken with a number of our customers. And those customers, they range from small customers in some cases to very large industrial customers, which, despite the relatively small volumes, the conversion to LNG could require some time. So our final commercial decision to move ahead to switch to LNG, in some cases, it does take a bit of a time. But it\\'s just a matter of really those customers really progressing their internal approval processes to be in a position to fully commit under the contract. So I think we have given a breakdown of the status of the different commercial initiatives that we have today in order to provide a sense of how those discussions are progressing. What we can say is that despite the challenging environment due to COVID, we have been able to secure additional contracts. We have been able to continue to engage with all of the customers in a vehicle way. And we believe that the thesis is we\\'re the strongest before the pandemic, so we really believe and we are extremely confident that the business plan will be achievable according to our expectations. RANDALL GIVEANS: Excellent. Thanks for all that color. And I guess finally, just on that, is there an expiration date where they have to kind of secure or convert those MOUs or contracts? Or is it just kind of whenever they\\'re ready? EDUARDO MARANHAO: No, there is no specific deadline on those specific MOUs and LOIs. As I said, it\\'s a matter of, in some cases, some commercial aspects. In some others, some technical requirements that take a little bit longer for the customers to take a decision to commit to LNG. RANDALL GIVEANS: Yes. Good deal. Well, that\\'s it for me. Glad to see Golar back above double digits. So keep it going. IAIN ROSS: Yes. Thank you. OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Webber. MICHAEL WEBBER, MANAGING PARTNER, WEBBER RESEARCH & ADVISORY LLC: Okay. So the first question is on the strategic review and just to kind of follow up on Jon. So for -- I guess for those of us that have been following Golar for a few -- for several years, it can feel -- you feel a little bit like window dressing in terms of the technicalities of completing a strategic review and putting it to the Board. I mean this review in effect has been going on for several years at this point. So I\\'m curious as you stand now, what are the major hurdles? And are you any more or less likely to involve third-party capital today than you were, say, 1 year, 1.5 years ago when -- towards the early innings of this review? IAIN ROSS: Let me tackle that. That doesn\\'t feel that one is where do we want to go. We did that last quarter, 4 legs. Step 2 was identify the routes to get there. We did that this quarter. Board approved us to move those routes to get them executed. That depends on agreements that need to be struck and plan put in place that involves other people. And so the Board said, \"Yes, go ahead and have those conversations. Get that organized,\" in some cases. In other cases, it doesn\\'t, and we\\'re getting that all lined up. And then as soon as we\\'ve got that lined up, we go back to the Board and say, \"Here we go.\" And then they\\'ll either say yes or no. So that\\'s the sort of -- that\\'s the clear path. I can\\'t draw a conclusion from the past before certainly at least I got here. To your question about involving third-party capital, I now speak personally, I think the benefit of having -- I think we\\'ve signaled quite clearly. The benefit of having 4 legs is that it does, as we\\'ve said in the past, it allows us to align the business, the risk/return of each one of those businesses to the risk/return of different sector investors. So I think there\\'s a benefit there of doing that. And one wouldn\\'t seek to get a line like this if it wasn\\'t to make it easier for third-party investors to come in, right? So I\\'m sort of answering your question, and that\\'s why we\\'re doing it. So that makes all the sense in the world. What I can\\'t do is prejudge a Board decision or market conditions or interest from everybody else because that\\'s outside my control. But the purpose of getting agreement to line up in those 4 columns is to make this easier, and the agreement and the debate with the Board is to identify the path to get there. That\\'s sort of... MICHAEL WEBBER: Yes. No, the angle of my question is that this -- in one form or another, let\\'s put it this way, this review has been going on for several years, right, and so there are a number of solutions. It\\'s not an easy equation to solve for, but there are a number of solutions that have been on the table, some of which I\\'m sure involves third party or private equity, some of which they don\\'t. And I guess what I\\'m asking is, as we are now further into, I guess, this iteration of the strategic review, is it fair to say it\\'s less likely to involve third-party capital? And/or is it something that you think would be done in a series of transactions or maybe as a group of kind of a bundled transaction where we come in one day and we see a release that clearly lays out what the new Golar structure would look like? IAIN ROSS: It\\'s clear in my mind, Mike, what it needs to be, but I\\'m one of -- I\\'m part of the team, right, and so it\\'s about getting that organized. So it\\'s not a lack of certainty on my side. At least, it\\'s not a lack of certainty. But one has to build all the pieces together and get everything ready in, and there\\'s a lot of bits and pieces that need to -- moving parts that need to work. So that\\'s how I see it. To your question about is it a series of steps, is it a bundle? That depends on the path that the Board chooses and different steps. So it\\'s sort of bit of both would be my view. But here is how... MICHAEL WEBBER: I\\'m asking whether -- I was asking whether one\\'s more likely or not now at this -- that we\\'re a few years into it, I guess, of multiple iterations of this. Just trying to see how that process has changed and what we should expect without holding you to a specific answer. Just a bit more color on that in terms of what the most likely scenario is going to look like. IAIN ROSS: Yes, I\\'m going to pass that one, if I can. I\\'m sorry because it does -- it requires agreements to be struck with other people, and it requires Board\\'s approval and all kinds of different steps, right? And it would be wrong with me to give you guidance on that now when those pieces are not in place. I\\'m clear where the pieces need to move. But until they\\'ve moved, I really shouldn\\'t -- I shouldn\\'t -- I wouldn\\'t be doing my job right if I gave you the detail that I have in my head about what I think is going to happen, right? So I\\'m sorry, but we need to wait for the sort of agreement to be struck and the Board to approve or not as I think you said. MICHAEL WEBBER: Yes. No, we\\'ve been waiting. I guess I\\'m just looking for like any indication of what -- how it\\'s progressing, but I can take that off-line. Eduardo, on the downstream, the part of what makes Golar Power so unique and what has made it so successful relative to its peers has been really kind of thoughtful and deliberate strategy to kind of surround Brazil. So when you\\'ve got a lot of competitors kind of swinging and missing and feeling like they\\'re stretched a bit on the global -- like a global scale, you guys have had success really kind of being all in on Brazil. So within the context of expanding that elsewhere, I\\'m curious, is that -- to what degree is that a function of maybe having picked the majority of the low-hanging fruit you think are there -- is there in Brazil? And to what degree is that a function of looking at markets with maybe more amicable power auctions? Or I\\'m just trying to get a bit of context around how realistic it would be for you to go all in on another geography, I guess, and why considering the degree of success you\\'re having there. EDUARDO MARANHAO: Okay. Mike, so I think when we look into Brazil, I think it\\'s important to note that we have been developing this opportunity for over the past 5 years now. That was when we were awarded the PPA in Sergipe back in April 2015. So I wouldn\\'t say that we have gone all in from day 1. I think that our exposure to Brazil, it has grown over time. I think it\\'s -- the more we have been getting to know the market and being exposed to the opportunity, I think we increased our presence in the country. I think what was actually extremely important to our current status of -- in the market was the fact that we were able to identify very strategic partners. In the case of Sergipe, we teamed up with Barcarena in Brazil. In the case of a small-scale development, we teamed up with the BR Distribuidora. Golar has been working with Petrobras for a number of years since 2007. So I think that all helped to position ourselves to where we are today in the Brazilian market. And I think that particularly to that market, everything that is going on with regards to the opening up of the gas market is extremely positive to our thesis, and this will help to accelerate the development of our strategy across the whole country. But when we go and when we look at the global growth strategy, I think it\\'s important to highlight that one of the key pillars of our strategy is to build strategic hubs from which we are able to not only sell power, able not only to sell gas, we\\'re able not only to sell LNG, we\\'re able to do a number of different activities, which as we build up those incremental revenues, they become extremely attractive. So in some cases, we\\'ll be able to understand an investment in a given terminal with a relatively low rate of return. But as we grow and as we establish the presence, I think that the moat will become extremely attractive. We used to say that in certain countries, whoever comes first will be the last one to come because it takes a long time to establish an LNG terminal from a regulatory point of view, from an environmental point of view and from a commercial point of view as well. So I would say that different countries will require different strategies. One of the key ways that we believe that we\\'ll be able to be successful in that will be to find the right partner in the right market. MICHAEL WEBBER: Got you. Would it be fair to assume -- and this is the last one, I\\'ll turn it over. But in terms of kind of laying the groundwork for one of these strategic hubs, is that something where you would want to have boots on the ground and kind of deliver -- kind of develop some degree of local expertise while you\\'re sourcing that partner? And is that something you -- should we see noticeable CapEx, if you will, even if it\\'s on the smaller side as you look to kind of build out that presence in a specific hub? EDUARDO MARANHAO: Absolutely. I would not say a very relevant CapEx in the beginning. But for sure, we intend to increase our presence in the strategic markets by having boots on the ground and having a dedicated team in certain strategic locations. I think that\\'s a key fundamental strategy to achieve that growth. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of [Joe Ringheim]. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So Callum, first on financing and liquidity. You\\'ve refinanced the Bear and said that you expect within the coming quarters to refinance Frost and Seal as well as the loan security against the equity in power and the margin loan. Could you provide any details around how much cash you expect to release on these refinancings? CALLUM MITCHELL-THOMSON: Yes. Nothing, 0 cash release on the Seal. That\\'s about removing the put that occurs in January or at least addressing the put that occurs in January. For the Frost, I think we had guided previously in last quarter with setbacks. We were expecting to generate between $50 million and $90 million of additional liquidity across all the vessels, and you will note that we\\'ve just done the Bear that generated $40 million. So I think for the Frost, you should expect us to make good on that commitment and generate something in the region of the balance needed to achieve that, so probably around another $30 mil or $40 million. That is -- that takes care of the vessels. When it comes to the RCF, I think the additional liquidity from that will be minimal. We would expect that we\\'re refinancing a $30 million and $150 million, and we\\'ve said that we were looking at an RCF in the region of $200 million and above. So you should assume that the additional liquidity from that is small. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And then regarding Power, you\\'ve announced several partnerships and downstream development in Power recently. And in my opinion, clearly capitalizing on the presence in Brazil, and as Eduardo is pointing out, you could also be able to replicate the business all in other regions. My question is New Fortress Energy, a company involved in internal and downstream operations in other regions, do you consider that company to be a relevant peer for Golar Power? And given the metrics and also that the stock is that up 70% this year, is that something you\\'re monitoring in order to consider a potential listing of Power? EDUARDO MARANHAO: Joe, good to talk to you. I would say that if you look at our businesses, we do have some complementary and some similar activities and business lines as New Fortress Energy. I think that we view the market on which we are most exposed, which is Brazil, as a market big enough for us to dedicate most of our time, as we have been doing over the past 4 years since the foundation of Golar Power. We believe that as we have said earlier today that the view is really the stepping shown for our global growth ambitions. If we get it right in Brazil, we\\'re extremely confident that we\\'ll be able to replicate in some way, not necessarily with the same strategy, but we\\'ll be able to replicate a hub strategy in other countries. When you look at all the work that New Fortress is doing in the countries they operate, I think in a way, there are some similarities to what we\\'re doing. But we believe that our businesses and the activities that we\\'re pursuing in Brazil, they are in a way broader in the sense that we are able to generate power, we\\'re able to capture the upside and the incremental revenues from merchant power. We are in the downstream sector. We are positioned with our small-scale LNG distributions. And we are positioning ourselves in a way to capture the spreads between the substitution of more expensive and more pollutant fuels such as diesel, LPG, heavy fuel oil for LNG. So I would say that the range of activities that we are developing and we are currently operating are in a way wider than what they are currently doing. OPERATOR: Your next question here is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee. JAMES YOON;CITIGROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is James on for Chris. Just wanted to touch on the small-scale distribution detail you provided. How should we really think about sort of -- what should we really expect from the LOIs and then conversions to executing contracts and then sort of like EBITDA per contract on average? Just trying to get a sense of really what we should expect from that either in the near term or maybe a few years out? IAIN ROSS: Eduardo? EDUARDO MARANHAO: Sure. I think that when we look at the pace of development of our small-scale strategy, as I said, despite the COVID environment, we have been able to continue to execute and to continue to engage with customers. We believe that we\\'ll be able to accelerate the pace of conversion from LOIs to actually firm contracts over the past -- over the next few quarters. I think it\\'s important that we bring online the other terminals that we are developing, such as the Suape terminal, which is one initiative that we are extremely excited with. And we believe that we\\'ll be in a position to -- in some point next year to commence operation of that terminal. And I think there\\'s always a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation in which some customers, they want to see the commencement and the real start of the activities to really engage. So as you imagine if you have a sizable industrial operations and something that is -- the energy supply is a critical component of your operations. So it\\'s not something that we can switch from one day to the other without having 100% sure that what we are promising will be delivered to them in accordance to all the specs and to the level of reliability that is required. So we believe that once operations start, the pace of conversion from LOIs to actual contracts will accelerate. JAMES YOON;CITIGROUP INC.: Got it. And then any color on how to think about the average EBITDA or maybe ranges for the executed contract? EDUARDO MARANHAO: Currently, I think we are just disclosing the number of actual contracts. As you can imagine, those contracts, they vary quite a bit in terms of volume and also in terms of margin. I don\\'t think it will be appropriate to give a specific margin or specific average volume as of today. I think we -- as soon as we commence operations, we\\'ll be able to disclose a bit further those information. JAMES YOON;CITIGROUP INC.: All right. Got it. Actually, just before I hand it over, just maybe to follow up on that. Can you just maybe give a sense of the direction possibly? Will you imagine to stay relatively stable? Or should it just move -- take a step function higher at some point as the project ramps up further? IAIN ROSS: Eduardo, that\\'s a further question on the small-scale ramp-up. EDUARDO MARANHAO: Yes. So as I was saying, we believe that once operations start, we\\'ll be able to further accelerate the pace of conversions. Another point on which we are extremely hopeful that we\\'re going to have a great development is with regards to our partnership with BR Distribuidora. As it was announced, we entered into a commercial partnership with BR, which can expand its scope into the form of a corporate partnership. And we continue a very close dialogue and a very close engagement with BR in order to try to develop that opportunity, which we believe is the greatest opportunity that we have when you look into the Brazilian market. I think Brazilian market has over 2.7 million trucks with the consumption of LNG equivalent volume of close to 35 million tons of LNG. And if we\\'re able to tap that into that market, it\\'s a market which is substantially big and attractive for us to pursue. So we\\'re very excited with the prospects of that opportunity, and we believe that BR is the right partner in the right country. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Mandy Ramat. SANJAY RAMASWAMY, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sorry. I think the operator got my name wrong there. It\\'s Sanjay calling from Bank of America. Maybe just some color on the state of the capacity in the LNG market. I think, Iain, you prior mentioned that there are about 27 vessels scheduled in \\'20 to be delivered and about 75 in \\'21 and \\'22. So maybe just your expectations on that and whether that\\'s changed in a pre-COVID, post-COVID. Some color on that would be helpful. IAIN ROSS: I think that the -- there\\'s 2 things happening. One is of course we\\'ve got new capacity coming on stream, particularly out of the U.S. Some of that\\'s been delayed, and we\\'ve got a whole pile of cargoes delayed. And as we got vessels planned for delivery, there\\'s an anticipation or an expectation that some of these will be put back by a number of months to try and align themselves. And most -- and forgive me, I forget the exact number. But most, the majority of those vessels, so certainly over half are already linked into some of these new contracts coming on. So you\\'ve got a sort of linkage there, and then obviously there\\'s some vessels coming into the spot market. What\\'s also interesting is that we have a number of steam turbines in the fleet -- in the global fleet, they\\'re due to come off charter over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. And they\\'re coming off in a regular number per year. And the interesting thing for those vessels is whilst they -- some of them may be completely debt-free, they have a very relatively high -- I\\'m sorry, low operating efficiency, and for that, a high operational cost. And it will be interesting to see just how many of those can survive in the spot market. And therefore, do we see the start of the first wave of LNG carriers being scrapped? So I think the dynamic is changing over the next few years. Yes, there\\'s new builds, and I think there\\'s a deferral of new builds happening. But equally, we\\'ve got some long-term charters coming to the end and question about what will happen to those vessels, and then what does that do as a knock-on effect and consequence to the rest of the fleet. SANJAY RAMASWAMY: That\\'s helpful. In terms of percentages, would you be able to talk maybe about the percentage of those long-term charters coming to the end of that duration? Is there a split there? IAIN ROSS: In terms of the number of vessels, I\\'d be making it up. I can get that afterwards. We can text you afterwards, we\\'ll give you the detail. SANJAY RAMASWAMY: Sure, that\\'s helpful. And maybe just to talk through the development of the Mark III, maybe just providing some color on the time line there and perhaps different cost economics versus Hilli. I think in the release, it was mentioned that it\\'d be one of the lower cost per ton LNG solutions versus greenfield. So maybe just color on that would be helpful. IAIN ROSS: There\\'s 2 ways to look at it. There\\'s the cost per ton, and we\\'ve been public in saying that we can do Hilli cost per ton all in for less than $500 per ton. And that compares extremely favorably with even the brownfield LNG developments around the world. So that\\'s a kind of a \"finger in the air\" number. What we\\'re seeing is with the new build coming through that cost to us is all of similar nature, and what that means as you translate it through is that the tolling agreement that we can offer customers on our lease arrangements is very competitive in terms of dollars per MMBtu to give us a required return on the project over the lifetime of that project. So what we\\'re seeing is as we\\'ve gone through the Mark III design, and I think surprisingly to some of our people, is that the costs that we\\'re able to come up with is in keeping the design simple. And I keep saying simple design, but I think it\\'s a very, very important part of what we\\'re trying to do here: keep the design simple, repeatable. And the smarts have gone into what the sort of the basic design to start with both the hull and the topsides. And as we start to push the envelope on capacity, we see the economy of scale kicking in per -- in cost per ton, and those vessels are looking like they\\'re going to be very competitive. And I did mention in the prepared remarks, we\\'re also seeing our carbon footprint of those on a like-for-like basis being globally competitive as well. So we\\'re pleased with the progress and still pushing. SANJAY RAMASWAMY: Sure. That\\'s helpful. And just maybe the time line on the Mark III in terms of... IAIN ROSS: Time line on the Mark III, we\\'ve completed our FID. So client-specific activities, we really were in advance discussions with the yard around what EPC costs would be. What we need is a customer that\\'s prepared to stand up and do this with us, and we\\'ll be ready to go. And I think you\\'re talking about a 4-year cycle from start to finish from the point we take FID. OPERATOR: Your next question, it\\'s -- your last question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman. JASON DANIEL GABELMAN, DIRECTOR, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask on Golar Power and the cash flow that it\\'s kicking back up to Golar right now. Following the Sergipe startup, are you getting any distributions from Golar Power? And how do you see that evolving over the next few years given the projects that you\\'ve laid out to execute within Golar Power? EDUARDO MARANHAO: Jason, I think when you look at the future cash flow distribution from Golar Power, it was stated before that we intend to use that excess cash flows to fund our existing growth plans. So in a way, we are self-funding our growth strategy. And we believe that with the cash flow from Sergipe and from the Nanook, we will be able to be in a position to fully fund the development of our operations in the small scale and other projects. JASON DANIEL GABELMAN: Okay. So is that to suggest no cash flow coming up to the parent right now or in the next couple of years? EDUARDO MARANHAO: In the near term, we don\\'t expect to -- we believe that we\\'ll be in a better position to fund the existing growth opportunities that we have in our portfolio then to distribute the excess cash flows to the parent shareholders. JASON DANIEL GABELMAN: Got it. And if I could just ask a quick question on the restructuring efforts. You\\'re talking about entering new territories and building out storage hubs that could do multiple activities. And I wonder if you do go forward breaking up the company, do you get into a scenario where you\\'re now bidding against competitors for some of those other activities that you\\'re trying to build out from hub? For example, if you\\'re building a power project and you want to do it with an FSRU but the FSRU is in a separate company than the power projects in, are you then opening yourself up to potential competitors to bid on the project as well? IAIN ROSS: Let me take that one, guys. So the beauty of the exercise that Callum has explained I think very well that it creates the opportunity for investable companies that are split by asset classes, so shipping, power, the FSRU and the LNG companies. The beauty of working across the group is that we have the opportunity to collaborate. And I think if you talk about the FSRU power example, I think there\\'s a big difference between responding to a tender in the market to do a bareboat charter for an FSRU. And the taking of an FSRU, and as Eduardo described, putting that through development into a hub to create a very strategic asset that multiple downstream businesses can sort of develop from. And I think the -- having that structure, having the assets in one particular part of the group of companies, if you want to call it that, it actually makes it easier for us to do inter-company deals and arrangements. And I don\\'t see that an FSRU-alone company will have the ability to do what, for example, Golar Power is doing. And vice versa, I don\\'t think Golar Power has the appetite to simply respond to tenders for the provision of an FSRU when it can make so much more business out of taking that FSRU and putting it to work. So to the contrary, we actually see great synergies between the groups. And the restructuring that we\\'ve talked about as we try to make that go forward will create simplicity in the business and facilitate that collaboration in a far easier way. Thank you, operator. Thanks to everyone for your participation and your interest in Golar. Please stay safe in this COVID time, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter. And with that, goodbye. OPERATOR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. [] ASC Services LLC'\n",

Presentation OPERATOR: Good day, and welcome to the Synaptics Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. Today\\'s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Tsai. Please go ahead, sir. JASON TSAI, HEAD OF IR, SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED: Thank you, and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today on Synaptics Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. My name is Jason Tsai and I am the Head of Investor Relations. With me on today\\'s call are Michael Hurlston, our President and CEO; and Dean Butler, our CFO. This call is also being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the company\\'s website at synaptics.com. In addition to a supplemental slide presentation, we have also posted a copy of these prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website. The supplementary slides have also been furnished as an exhibit to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC earlier today and add additional color on our financial results. In addition to the company\\'s GAAP results, management will also provide supplementary results on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes share-based compensation, acquisition related costs, and certain other noncash or recurring or nonrecurring items. Please refer to the press release issued after market close today for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results. Additionally, we would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call we will be making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. Although Synaptics believes our estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control and may prove to be inaccurate. Synaptics cautions that actual results may differ materially from any future performance suggested in the company\\'s forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\\'s current and periodic reports filed with the SEC, including the Synaptics Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019, for important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Synaptics expressly disclaims any obligation to update this forward-looking information. Now before we get started, I\\'d like to announce that we are planning on hosting our Analyst Day in June in New York and we look forward to discussing more details about our long-term strategy and targets with you at that time. I will be sending out more details shortly. I will now turn the call over to Michael. MICHAEL E. HURLSTON, PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED: Thanks, Jason, and I\\'d like to welcome everyone to today\\'s call. I\\'m pleased to be speaking with all of you again today and report an outstanding quarter and finish to calendar 2019. In the December quarter, we saw unusually strong demand from our largest mobile customer as well as in our PC business, leading to results that were better than what we forecasted 3 months ago. We continued to be disciplined with our spending, resulting in OpEx that was lower than expected. All of this led to our first quarter of 20% non-GAAP operating margin in more than 5 years, and a record quarter for non-GAAP net income and EPS. Dean will go into more details on our financial performance later in the call, but I\\'m really pleased by our team\\'s execution and the operational control and efficiencies that we\\'ve put in place and are beginning to impact our bottom line. Now let me update you on the progress we\\'re making in transforming Synaptics and reshaping our business to deliver sustainable, high-margin long-term growth. Toward the end of last year, we started the process of our strategic review internally to assess our opportunities and risks. While we\\'re still early in the process, I\\'m really encouraged by the highly differentiated capabilities in products like our OLED touch and our low-power, high-performance edge-computing SoCs. These SoCs feature embedded neural networks and AI capabilities for smart audio and video devices and can span a variety of end markets. While we\\'re excited about the opportunities in these product areas and will continue to invest here, we will also certainly deemphasize other parts of the portfolio in order to continue to keep spending in a reasonable envelope. As part of our portfolio optimization, we announced in December the divestiture of our mobile LCD TDDI product line for $120 million and we expect that this transaction will close in the June quarter. This is the right move for Synaptics as our mobile LCD TDDI was already very margin dilutive and with ongoing ASP pressure, it would have continued to be a drag on gross margins had we not made the move to divest this product line. We do retain our ability to develop and sell discrete display and touch solutions, TDDI for OLED displays and TDDI for automotive. One of the ways we would look to use the cash from this sale is to look at inorganic opportunities to add more differentiated, high-margin, accretive assets to our portfolio. Dean will provide more details later as to the financial impact on our P&L that this transaction is expected to have. Now let me update you on our businesses. In mobile, as I mentioned earlier, we saw unusual strength and demand from our largest mobile customer in the December quarter and that strength continues into this quarter. Demand for the handsets that our display drivers are powering continues to exceed expectations in the short term and we continue to benefit at this current product cycle -- as this current product cycle plays out. We\\'re also seeing strong demand and design momentum with our OLED touch sensor. As you may remember, our first win was with the Huawei Mate 30 Pro last year and we\\'re making very good progress with our customers in delivering a differentiated touch solution with premium features that include active pen support, face detection, and support for high report rates of 90Hz and 120Hz on the latest generation of on-cell flexible OLED displays. I\\'m very excited by our pipeline here and I\\'m confident that our industry-leading OLED touch controllers will be a meaningful growth driver for Synaptics long term, driven by the ramp of flexible OLED panel production. Moving to IoT, this business performed as expected in the quarter and as new product launches with multiple customers delivered solid results. At CES last month, we announced and demoed several new IoT products including our VS600 family of edge-computing software-enriched SoCs that combine CPU, GPU and NPU with over 6 teraops performance to power audio, video, computer vision and deep learning AI capabilities, combining intelligence and personalization to provide an enhanced experience for consumers. We\\'re seeing strong interest from retail device makers and TV service providers and this new family of SoCs will power a new generation of smart displays, smart cameras, soundbars, set-top boxes, voice-enabled devices, and other emerging connected products. Our design pipeline continues to grow across all of our IoT segments and we are confident that the business will continue to be a strong growth driver for Synaptics. In PC, we saw unusual strength this quarter driven by a couple of different dynamics. As we talked about last quarter, we saw what we believe to be accelerated orders ahead of the anticipated tariffs that were supposed to be enacted in December but we also saw strength in the enterprise market as companies continue to upgrade to Windows 10 ahead of Windows 7 support that ended in January. While we do not expect this strength in the PC market to be sustainable, we continue to enjoy high market share in our fingerprint and touchpad product lines. Overall, I\\'m really excited by the momentum we are seeing in our business. We have a strong pipeline of wins with all our major customers. Our strategy to focus on more differentiated solutions that have higher margins is beginning to pay off and our operational discipline is averaging -- is adding leverage to our model. We still have a lot of work ahead of us in this transformation, but I\\'m very encouraged by the early progress we\\'re making and our incredible team that is executing towards a stronger, more profitable future for Synaptics. Now let me turn the call over to Dean to review our second quarter financials and provide our outlook. DEAN WARREN BUTLER, CFO, SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon to everyone. I\\'ll start with a review of our financial results for our recently completed quarter and then provide our current outlook for our fiscal Q3. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 of $388 million was approximately 6% above the high end of our previous guidance range, up 14% from the preceding quarter, and down 9% from the same quarter last fiscal year. Our revenue strength from the quarter primarily reflects better-than-expected demand from our largest LCD display customer and from our PC customers. During the quarter we had 2 customers above 10% of revenue, at 21% and 13%. For the December quarter, our GAAP gross margin was 41%, which includes $8.2 million of intangible asset amortization, $600,000 of share-based compensation costs, $200,000 of retention program costs, and $1.8 million partial reversal of a previously accrued loss on a supplier commitment agreement. GAAP operating expenses for the December quarter were $124.8 million, which includes share-based compensation of $14.5 million, intangibles amortization of $3 million, restructuring expenses of $13.3 million, and retention program costs of $3.4 million. We accrued a GAAP tax expense in the quarter of $12 million, bringing the year-to-date GAAP tax rate to 22.3%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $19.8 million, or a net income of $0.58 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our December quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 42.9% was 40 basis points above the high end of our guidance range and primarily reflects ongoing cost saving initiatives and an overall better product mix. The December quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were below the low end of our guidance range at $89.2 million and down $6.3 million from the preceding quarter; primarily reflecting the benefit of restructuring activities that have resulted in the achievement of the previously announced $40 million in annualized OpEx savings 6 months ahead of schedule. And to reiterate Michael\\'s comments from earlier, I\\'m pleased to point out that our 20% non-GAAP operating margin for this quarter was the first in more than 5 years for Synaptics. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date period was 12%. Non-GAAP net income for the December quarter was $70.1 million or $2.04 per diluted share, a 29% increase year-over-year compared with $54.4 million or $1.55 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Both of these were a record high for the company. Now turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $425 million of cash on hand, an increase of $74 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by cash flow from operations. Receivables at the end of December were $246 million and DSOs dropped to 57 days. Inventory were $103 million and inventory days were 42, down from 63 in the prior quarter, reflecting stronger product demand throughout the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.2 million and depreciation was $8.1 million. Before I turn to our guidance, please -- let me discuss the expected impact of our mobile LCD TDDI divestiture. We expect this transaction to close in our fourth fiscal quarter and when it does, we will receive $120 million for this product line plus an additional cash payment for on-hand inventory at that time. From a P&L perspective, let me give you a sense and scale and scope of this mobile LCD TDDI product line. For the last fiscal year, 2019, revenue was more than $300 million and gross margins were in the mid-20s. Mobile LCD TDDI is a profitable product line for Synaptics and while most of the associated OpEx will move off our P&L, we will retain some of the OpEx in the form of trapped costs that will take us several quarters to unwind. Revenue from this product line is expected to decline in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal \\'19 as we\\'ve been more selective in the mobile LCD TDDI revenue opportunities which we pursued so that gross margins this year will be higher in fiscal \\'19 -- will be higher than fiscal \\'19 but still meaningfully dilutive to the corporate average. We will provide additional color after the transaction closes. Now let me discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Based on our backlog entering the March quarter of approximately $284 million, subsequent bookings, customer forecasts, product sell-in and sell-through timing patterns as well as expected product mix, we anticipate our total revenue for the March quarter, which includes mobile TDDI, to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million. We expect the revenue mix from our mobile, IoT, and PC products to be 52%, 24% and 24%, respectively. I will now provide GAAP outlook for our March quarter and follow with non-GAAP outlook. We expect our GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 39.5% to 41.5%. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $115 million to $120 million, which includes charges for intangibles amortization, stock-based compensation, and we also expect to accrue restructuring and retention-related costs. Finally, we expect our GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be in the range of 20% to 25% for the fiscal year. I will now provide non-GAAP outlook for our March quarter. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter to be between 42% and 44% and anticipate this to be our third consecutive quarter with non-GAAP gross margins above 40%. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter to be in the range of $88 million to $91 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2020 to continue to be in the range of 11% to 13%. Our non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the March quarter is anticipated to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.60 per share. This wraps up our prepared remarks. So now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to the operator to start the Q&A session. Operator? Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We\\'ll take our first question from Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company. CHARLES LOWELL ANDERSON, VP AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, DOUGHERTY & COMPANY LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. And congrats on the strong results. I wanted to start with gross margins. You guys have made a lot of progress there so far. I wonder that maybe you guys could summarize what\\'s been done so far in terms of cost-saving initiatives that help gross margin sort of beyond mix and potentially what\\'s left to do? And then just sort of taking aside the LCD TDDI transaction, what are some of the other levers that are available to you to enhance gross margin? And then I\\'ve got a follow-up. MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: Yes, Charlie, this is Michael. Thanks for the nice words. I think that we -- the first benefit, obviously, is on mix. We\\'ve had some, Dean alluded to in his remarks. We\\'ve walked back from some of the TDDI business that in the past, I think we would have taken. And I think we\\'ve talked about that on the last couple of calls. So that\\'s certainly been a benefit, but we definitely have a lot more operational focus. And we\\'ve started really looking at our costs, and that means our variable cost, whether it\\'s from suppliers, from -- in all parts of the supply chain. And I think we\\'re in the very early innings there, but we started to find opportunities where we can take some cost out of the business. We\\'re going to continue to do that. I think that\\'s going to be a multi-quarter project. We\\'re trying it. I think you and I talked about to rationalize our supply chain. Right now, our supply chain is very, very wide. And I think that by making some moves to consolidate the supply chain, we should get some more leverage and hopefully get some better cost out of the system. But -- I think we\\'re still in the early innings there. So there\\'s still some room, we think we have on the gross margin line. CHARLES LOWELL ANDERSON: Great. Thanks so much for the color. And then for my follow-up, a question on IoT, kind of a 2-parter here. It looks like you\\'ll be up sequentially in March. I think the typical seasonal pattern is that you\\'ve been down historically in March in IoT. So maybe just wondering what\\'s different this year? And then I think heading into the year, the thought was that, that business for the full year to grow in the low teens. And I think you\\'ll need maybe $100 million a quarter or so in June for that to happen. So maybe just update us on your view on IoT for the full year? DEAN WARREN BUTLER: So I\\'ll let Michael handle the visibility on IoT from a project perspective, but just to give you a little bit of color. So IoT as a business, sequentially, Q3 midpoint versus kind of Q2 actual is slightly down as where we think for the March quarter. It is up year-on-year. And so in a seasonal pattern, this is actually seasonally down in our fiscal Q3. So just to give you a little color, it\\'s seasonally down. We\\'re up double digits year-on-year from where we were last year. So really positive on kind of where this thing has kind of been growing. Michael, if you want to make a MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: Yes. I mean, Charlie, I think, we continue to see nice areas of strength across the portfolio. We talked about Edge SoCs, I think that we have a nice design pipeline there and continue to be optimistic about the growth. The wired audio business, we\\'ve talked about some wins there with some in box headsets, and I think we clicked off another couple. So we continue to be pretty excited about that business. And then, of course, the video interface business continues to click along. It\\'s a lower portion or a smaller portion of our overall portfolio, but is accretive on the margin line and we continue to grow that business as well. So I think we continue to be optimistic. As Dean said, this next coming quarter is down, but I think that\\'s in line with what we normally see in terms of seasonal patterns. OPERATOR: We\\'ll take our next question from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. CHRISTOPHER ADAM JACKSON ROLLAND, SENIOR ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP, LLLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Very nice quarter. Display manufacturing is pretty heavy in the Wuhan region. I know that 2 of the leading Chinese OLED display manufacturers are there. I think Tianma is there. But there wasn\\'t a lot of commentary about how this might affect your business. Just wonder how you\\'re looking at it? And what sort of adjustments we should have in our heads, at least, as we move through the quarter? DEAN WARREN BUTLER: Yes. So Chris, this is Dean. So let me just give you a little bit of sense, just how we thought about our guide for the quarter. So it\\'s a fluid situation. I think as everybody kind of points out, and there\\'s not a whole lot of clarity. I mean, given that there\\'s kind of the extended Lunar New Year right now for a lot of the factories in Greater China. But what I will say is our direct supply chain doesn\\'t run through to the Wuhan kind of region. Largely, our direct supply chain resides outside of Greater China for a large extent. But as you correctly point out, many of our customers\\' supply chains do run inside of Greater China. And so we\\'ve chosen to be just a little bit conservative on how we\\'ve guided this quarter, but we feel that we\\'ve kind of incorporated what we know as of today into our guide. CHRISTOPHER ADAM JACKSON ROLLAND: Great. And Dean, want to have you, yes, about the TDDI business, you said that revenue was $300 million, but it sounded like it was declining. So I\\'m wondering when this does eventually come out in June, how much less than the $75 million a quarter run rate should we be using? And then also on the gross margin side here, I\\'m getting like maybe a 450 basis point benefit for company gross margins when you take this out. But like you said, you\\'ve already locked away from some of the lower end staff. So would something like 300 basis points be more like it? DEAN WARREN BUTLER: So Chris, I\\'m not sure about your math because I think internally, we don\\'t quite get to the number that you\\'re kind of estimating. But to give you a sense on what this business size is, like I said, last fiscal year was a little bit north of $300 million. We\\'ve selectively walked away from a little bit business there. But it\\'s not vastly different. So I would say it\\'s kind of low double-digit kind of percentage that we probably walked from on how to sort of think about it. And remember, the other thing that you might want to think about incorporating this TDDI, this is the normal kind of mobile seasonality cycle that you would see. So I hope that helps. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We\\'ll take our next question from Ari Shusterman of Needham & Company. ARIEL JONATHAN SHUSTERMAN, ASSOCIATE, NEEDHAM & COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Ari taking the question for Raji Gill. So first off, I want to say good job on the great quarter. And my first question would be regarding the use of cash for further M&A? Are there certain areas, sectors, you want to particularly focus on? Or what can we expect in the future? MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: I don\\'t know, Ari, that we have specific areas of focus. What I will say thematically is that we\\'re -- I think in the past, the company has looked for bigger TAM acquisitions. There was Marvell and Conexant that we\\'re both in pursuit of large TAMs. And I think that Dean and I are more on the page of trying to do what I call tuck-ins that are going to be margin and operating income accretive. So we\\'re looking for perhaps smaller things that are going to be much more in line with our current business, adjacent to our current businesses and we\\'ll add on both the gross margin line and on the op margin line. So -- at least directionally, that\\'s where we\\'re going. As I said at the outset, I don\\'t know that we have anything specifically identified that meets that, but we certainly think that there are some things out there that can fall into that zone. ARIEL JONATHAN SHUSTERMAN: And then my follow-up would be about the set-top box market opportunity. Previously, you mentioned that this would be a big area of focus for you guys. Can you perhaps talk about your positioning there? When should we expect a potential ramp in that area? MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: I think we feel good about the opportunity on our Edge SoCs, generally. And I think that there\\'s -- the Edge SoCs, we\\'ve built a platform that can go into consumer applications. You\\'ve seen design wins from Saleel and his team on Google. We\\'ve talked about that in the past. We think that we have an interesting platform, for example, for video surveillance. And then, of course, they\\'re set-top box. And on set-top box, we today have very minimal market share. We\\'ve got some customers in Korea. We\\'ve got Swisscom. But generally speaking, our presence there is fairly small. We think that as a North American supplier, we have opportunity to grow the footprint potentially in North America, potentially in Europe, but I think those ramps will take some time. The customer base is obviously one that, first, we need to get qualified in their products, and then they need to ramp. It\\'s not a quick ramping segment. And I don\\'t expect, even in this calendar year to see much in terms of materiality in that space. OPERATOR: We\\'ll take our next question from Brett Simpson of Arete Research. BRETT WILLIAM SIMPSON, SENIOR ANALYST, ARETE RESEARCH SERVICES LLP: I have a question on the OLED touch opportunity that you see in front of you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have Huawei as your sort of first customer here. Can you maybe just talk more generally about how you see OLED touch? I mean we hear a lot about Yocto as a big opportunity here. And what gives you the confidence that we\\'re going to see sustainable differentiation for you guys in OLED touch? So that\\'s really the first question. MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: Yes, Brett. A fair question. I think that we definitely feel very good about our technology in the flexible OLED segment. Yocto is a specific Samsung brand. It is a thinner display, as you know. And the ability to pull out signal from a very noisy environment when your touch circuit is right up against the OLED, the pixels that are driving the display is really a challenge. And we feel like we\\'ve been able to resolve that with high-precision analog front ends, and we\\'re able to really pull signal out, a capacitive signal that represents your finger out of a very noisy backdrop that comes from the LCDs or the pixels that are being right next to the embedded touch circuit. We have proof points today, as you called out, and we stated in the remarks on Huawei. We think that we\\'ve got a good design pipeline there. And as a result of our differentiated technology. So we think that this is going to be a growing segment for us in the coming quarters. And we feel good about maintaining that. We\\'ve got a road map now that we\\'re very, very focused on OLED touch, and we think that we can maintain a lead there for a foreseeable set of design cycles. BRETT WILLIAM SIMPSON: And maybe just a quick follow-up on mobile, in general. If we look beyond fiscal \\'20, obviously, there\\'s a lot of moving parts here. You have -- the -- a closing of the deal for mobile TDDI. And we know TDDI, generally, is in a declining state. And then you also have your largest customer where LCD is not going to be around forever. And so I\\'m just looking at the mobile business that you see in front of you beyond fiscal \\'20, how do you think about growth? Or how do you think about managing the balance between some of those declining product cycles and areas like OLED touch? Do you think fiscal \\'21 or over the sort of medium term that mobile returns to year-on-year growth for Synaptics? MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: Yes. I mean, I think it\\'s hard to forecast. There are a lot of moving pieces, but I think that pundits had sort of written us off because they\\'ve seen this decline in the LCD display driver, and there\\'s no doubt that, that has been a declining segment for us. But I think that what\\'s not been appreciated is our differentiation on OLED touch, and we think that, certainly, that\\'s going to be a growing segment for us. How the 2 pieces move together? I don\\'t know that we have a good read on. It depends on how launches go next year and the mix looks between LCD and OLED. But we feel pretty good about the business right now. And certainly, from a gross margin perspective, we see opportunities there, depending on how the mix goes to continue to enhance gross margin and operating margin in our mobile segment. OPERATOR: We\\'ll take our next question from Paul Chung of JPMorgan. PAUL CHUNG, VP & IT HARDWARE ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: So just first up, just on your leverage levels, which are pretty excellent, will be even better after the sale of the TDDI business, but kind of longer term leverage levels are you comfortable with? And can you also remind us if you have any hedges in place to kind of offset some of the dilutive impact of your convertible? And how we should think about dilution there? And then I have a follow-up. DEAN WARREN BUTLER: Paul, this is Dean. So one, just on leverage ratio in June when we have our Analyst Day, which Jason kind of alluded to at the beginning of the call. We\\'ll be talking a little bit more about kind of cap structure there, so sort of stay tuned. But I would say where we are from a debt capacity level, we have clear capacity available to us. But right now, we have no intention of going to tap kind of more debt on the balance sheet. So one, let me just say that. And the other question that you had around, \"hey, do we have hedges on our convert and how to think about dilution?\" So no, our convert does not have any hedges directly attached to it. It does have a potential dilution factor, but the company does reserve a call provision that\\'s actually embedded inside of our instruments. PAUL CHUNG: Okay. And then just on PC demand, it looks like you expect another solid quarter in 3Q. Can you -- do you think you can quantify the pull-in demand you think kind of drove 2Q strength and maybe 3Q guide as well? And then as we kind of move out 6 to 12 months from now, do you think we kind of revert back to that mid-$60 million quarterly run rate? Or maybe possibly lower at the point kind of affects longer a bit? MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: Yes. I mean, I think that it is unusual. So I would say, generally, we\\'ll probably see it revert to our normal quarterly run rate. Our normal quarterly run rate is a bit higher than $60 million. But generally speaking, we should, to your point, revert back to that. It\\'s been a really pleasant surprise. I think that we talked about it in the prepared remarks, we thought last quarter was going to sort of be the end of it, given the -- what we thought were pull-ins ahead of the tariff, but we have a very nice quarter in front of us. And I think that what we\\'re seeing is, on a mix basis, a higher percentage of commercial laptops coming out. In those commercial laptops, we have better exposure to than consumer. Demand seems to be sort of up a little bit. I think the PC segment is growing 4% to 5%. But the commercial segment, and certainly, the customers were largely exposed to in the commercial segment, which are the big 3. They seem to maybe be doing better than average. So on balance, our business is growing higher than the run rate of the PC market. But again, I think that, that\\'s probably not sustainable. We do have very, very high market share in that segment. But for us to be growing meaningfully above the average growth rate of the PC market, given our high exposure is probably not one that was something that we should expect. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And at this time, we have no questions in queue. MICHAEL E. HURLSTON: Okay. With that, I\\'d really like to thank all of you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and certainly in our upcoming Analyst Day. Thank you very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\\'s conference. You may now disconnect. [] CQ-Roll Call, Inc.'\n",

All rights reserved. Presentation. OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Crimson Exploration's fourth quarter and year-end 2011 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Mr. Joe Grady. Please go ahead, sir. JOE GRADY, SVP, CFO, CRIMSON EXPLORATION INC.: Thank you. I'd like to welcome everybody to our conference call this morning. On the agenda, I'll start out reviewing the fourth-quarter financials. I will then turn it over to Allan Keel, our Chief Executive Officer, who will give you an overview of our 2011 accomplishments and a review of our current operations. Also have Steve Mengle, Senior VP of Engineering, with us and Carl Isaac, our Senior VP of Operations, to help us in the Q&A session that'll follow Allan's comments. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that the earnings release and the discussion that will be had here today contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and those statements include comments concerning Crimson's strategic plans, expectations and objectives for future operations. Such statements are based on assumptions we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. However, those statements are just estimates and not guarantees of future performance or results, and therefore, should be considered in that context. Jumping into a review of the financial results, our net loss for the quarter was $5 million compared to a net loss of $20.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding unrealized mark-to-market hedging gains and charges in 2011 and '10 quarters respectively, non cash impairment expense on unproved lease costs expiring during 2011 and higher than normal DD&A in the fourth quarter related to negative reserve revisions due to low gas prices, our net loss for the quarter would have been $3.5 million compared to a net loss of $2.4 million for the 2010 quarter. On EPS, net loss per basic share was $0.11 for the fourth quarter of '11, compared to a net loss per share of $0.50 for the prior-year quarter. Exclusive of the previously mentioned non cash items, our net loss per share, basic share, would have been $0.08 for the fourth quarter of '11 compared to a $0.06 loss for the fourth quarter 2010. Basic shares outstanding during the quarter, 2011 quarter were 43.9 million shares compared to 42.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2011, our adjusted EBITDAX, as we define in our release, was $17.3 million, slightly higher than the prior-year quarter of $16.7 million and slightly above the consensus estimate of $17 million. Free cash flow, which we define as our adjusted EBITDAX less interest expense, was $11.2 million, or $0.25 per basic share, also slightly higher than consensus estimates, and that's compared to free cash flow of $10.8 million, or $0.26 per basic share in the prior-year quarter. Both metrics reflect our ongoing transition to higher value oil and liquids production as a percent of total production, and that transition will continue and you'll hear more about that in a little bit, but that'll continue through 2012. Production for the fourth quarter of 2011 averaged 40 million Mcfe per day, which was within our guidance of 39 million to 43 million for the quarter. That also compared to 43 million a day in the fourth quarter of 2010. Consistent with our comments about transition, for the fourth quarter 2011, 34% of our production was oil and liquids compared to 28% in 2010. And as we've mentioned in our prior releases, we project by the middle of 2012 that that percentage will increase to 50% of our production. We do reflect production for the first quarter of 2012, our guidance of between 38 million to 40 million a day, which is obviously pretty comparable to the fourth quarter as we continue to shift to oils and liquid weighted projects that have lower production rates than the gas that we've been producing from the Haynesville in prior periods, but also carries with it a higher cash flow per unit and rates of return in this price environment. As we mentioned in a prior release, we did reach 40% liquids, oil and liquids production as a total, as a percent of our total during the first quarter, and we will continue to increase that, as mentioned. On a sales price basis, in the fourth quarter of '11, fuel prices decreased 70% over the prior-year quarter, primarily because of declines in gas prices. However, the increases in oil and NGL prices offset that. As a result, and on a realized basis, meaning including the results of hedges settled in the quarters and our increase in our percent of the liquids production, our weighted average price for the quarter was $7.45 per Mcfe versus $7.02 in the prior-year quarter. As we mentioned in our release, we did take advantage of the recent price spikes in oil and added derivative contracts to our existing hedge positions in an effort to maintain protection -- price protection for approximately 80% of our forecasted PDP oil production in 2012. We added, in February, we added Brent swaps on a total of 112,000 barrels for the April through December period at prices ranging from $114.85 to $118.30 and added WTI swaps of 14,000 barrels per month at $101.25 for 2013. And that position in 2013 represents approximately 50% of our currently forecasted PDP production. For the first quarter of 2012, we have approximately 1 Bcf of gas production, or roughly 48% of our PDP gas production hedged with puts at $5 per MMBtu, and approximately 90,000 barrels of oil, or roughly 77% of our PDP oil and NGL production that is crude price valued at an average floor of $95.73 per barrel. Moving to the operating costs, our direct lease operating costs in the fourth quarter were $3.7 million, or $1.00 per Mcfe, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.91 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2010. We have provided guidance for the first quarter 2012 of $4.2 million to $4.5 million, which is an increase that reflects both new wells coming on or that have come on during the quarter, and includes about $0.5 million for a work over in Liberty County, Texas. So on a recurring, normal recurring basis, I think you can peg our LOE at somewhere between $3.8 million and $4 million per quarter. G&A costs for the fourth quarter of '11 were $5.9 million, or $1.60 per Mcfe, compared to $6.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Exclusive of non cash stock option expense, cash G&A was $5.4 million, or $1.48 per Mcfe, compared to $6.1 million, or $1.55 for the fourth quarter of 2010. Higher than forecasted legal costs associated with one particular suit we are pursuing and performance-based comp in the fourth quarter contributed to the higher expense for the period. As you see in our release, the guidance that we're giving for the fourth quarter, I mean for the first quarter of 2012 is between $4.2 million and $4.6 million. On the CapEx side, we spent roughly $27 million in the fourth quarter, which gave us an annual capital investment of just over $88 million. At mid-year, we had raised our capital plans to accelerate drilling on our Eagle Ford oil projects, and specifically in Karnes County, which has been very successful. In addition, we spent $12 million on leasehold acquisitions during 2011, half of which was in our Southeast Texas area, and specifically in Madison and Grimes Counties where we're pursuing the Woodbine in 2012. As previously disclosed, our CapEx budget for 2012 is currently set at $74 million, which will be limited to our future cash flow for 2012, our free cash flow, sorry, which as we mentioned a little earlier is defined as EBITDA minus our interest expense for the year. At the end of the year, we had $79 million of availability on our credit facility, and our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for May 1, 2012. That concludes the financial review. I'll now turn it over to Allan for an operations update. ALLAN KEEL, CEO, CRIMSON EXPLORATION INC.: Thanks, Joe, good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us this morning as we discuss our fourth quarter and year-end results. I'm excited to discuss what we've accomplished in 2011 and I believe we have already built a lot of momentum in 2012 with our drilling program. Before jumping into current operations, let me discuss some of our 2011 highlights. In 2011, we accomplished two key strategic objectives, first in the beginning of the year, we secured our highest quality East Texas acreage that is now HBP. This acreage was initially targeted for the Haynesville and Mid-Bossier dry gas, and as you would expect, we did -- we have discontinued drilling up there due to the lower price environment. We're currently monitoring the activity around us up there on that acreage that we have there in San Augustine and Sabine Counties, as a result of some recent drilling for the James Lime formation up there that is very liquids rich. We think that our acreage is very prospective because this drilling is adjacent to and in some cases really on top of our acreage up there, so we're pretty excited about that. The second key strategic objective for 2011 was, after our initial success in Karnes County, we accelerated our drilling program there to increase our oil and liquids production which we were very excited about because we -- of the eight wells that we've drilled to date down there, each one of those wells has averaged a little bit over 1,060 barrels equivalent per day after cleanup. So very excited about that. And our two areas there are Littlepage McBride and Glasscock leases, and we've continued to see strong production from all of those wells. So that's been a very nice project. And we have one well currently drilling, and I'll talk more about that in a few moments. But in terms of production for 2011, we increased production by 28% to 16.6 Bcfe. And in the fourth quarter began to see a meaningful shift in more balanced liquids profile with 34% of our total production being oil and NGLs As Joe mentioned, we achieved 40% liquids production in late January and are still on track to come up -- to come 50% oil and liquids by mid-year 2012. And with regard to proven reserves, in 2011, we increased our proven reserves 20% to a total of 200.4 Bcfe, up from 166.5 Bcfe at year end 2010. Reserve additions including revisions totaled approximately 50.4 Bcfe, which led to a reserve replacement rate of 304% and F&D costs of $1.99 per Mcfe in 2011. And now I'll talk about our current drilling program. In the first quarter of 2012, we had been active in the Eagle Ford and have recently initiated our full-year program for the Woodbine oil play in East Texas where we currently have approximately 17,500 net acres. As we discussed in past, this area has been -- has seen a lot of resurgence of activity as a result of horizontal drilling and multi-stage frac technology. Adjacent to our acreage in Madison and Grimes County, offset operators have experienced excellent results using these exact same techniques in the re-development of the Woodbine. We believe additional horizontal potential exists in some of the other reservoirs including the Austin Chalk, the Buda, Georgetown, Lewisville and Glen Rose formations. And it's our plan this year to drill nine wells in that Woodbine play for 2012. As a matter of fact, over the weekend, we begin flow-back operations on our Mosely #1H well where we have approximately an 89% working interest, that's our first horizontal Woodbine well, and we completed that with using 23 stages of frac, fracture stimulation. Results are early, we've been very encouraged with our initial flow-back results through a smaller choke and we're continuing to clean up the well. Very encouraged by what we see and we'll report full -- we'll report initial production results on the well in the next couple of weeks as we continue to clean that well up. But we are very pleased with what we've seen so far. In addition to that Mosely well, we are currently drilling two other horizontal wells in Madison County and just permitted a third. Approximately one mile north of the Mosely 1H, the Grace Hall 1H well also targeted at Woodbine is drilling at approximately 8900 feet, toward a total measured depth of 16,230 feet. The other well that's drilling, the Vick Trust 1H, is located approximately six miles east of the Mosely 1H and will be Crimson's first horizontal well targeting the Lewisville formation and the Lewisville is right adjacent to the Woodbine formation from a stratigraphic perspective. This well is currently drilling at a little bit over 5,230 feet toward a total measured depth of 15,200 feet. Lateral lengths in both these wells will range between 6,000 to 7,000 feet with anticipated 20 to 25 stages of fracture stimulation. The production from these wells is expected to commence in mid-second quarter. Moving down to Karnes County, down in the Eagle Ford, the Glasscock A1H, where we have a 95%, a little bit over 95% working interest targeting the Eagle Ford shale, recently commenced production at a gross initial production rate of 726 barrels equivalent per day, which was 665 barrels of oil and 365 Mcf of gas. And that was on a 13/64-inch choke with 2743 pounds of casing pressure. We're very pleased with the results of this well and anticipate continuing to produce at a reduced rate on a smaller choke. Most of the wells, or really all of these wells that we drill prior to this Glasscock well had been reported down in Karnes County on a 16/64-inch choke. We maintain that -- we will maintain this well at a lower choke size, to see if there's any benefits of a more restricted rate and how that might impact EUR on our acreage position there in Karnes County. At the end of February, the Glasscock B1H, we spud that well and is currently drilling in a lateral section at 11,687 feet. The B1H well was drilled -- the first well was drilled in the Glasscock well was drilled to a totaled measured depth of 15,375 feet including a 4,350 foot lateral with 18 to 20 stages of frac. Completion operations are expected to commence in early April with our Glasscock well, our second Glasscock well, with initial production expected to commence later in that month. The Glasscock acreage was acquired by Crimson in 2011 after the successful experience on the adjacent Littlepage McBride lease. Continuing in the Eagle Ford, in Dimmit County, we've been flowing back the Beeler #1 since mid February and achieved a gross 24-hour initial rate of 370 barrels of oil equivalent, or 337 barrels of oil and 195 Mcfe of natural gas on a 18/64-inch choke. In Zavala County, the KM Ranch #2 well, our second well in that area, has been drilled to a total measured depth of 12,875 feet including a 6100-foot lateral and that well is awaiting completion. That completion -- the completion of the well has been delayed until we get flow back results in the Beeler well until we can determine what the best practice is there. As we discussed in the release, the Beeler rate is not as high as what we experienced in Karnes County, but it is consistent with what other operators have been achieving in the area. We remain optimistic that this area will be an economic source of oil production growth and we are aggressively studying that optimum lateral length, stimulation recipe and flow back design required to maximize the profitability in this area. There's also adjacent operators who are also drilling for the Buda offsetting some of our acreage here and have experienced some very nice results, so we're following that very closely as well. Crimson is in a great position to capitalize on our strong inventory of oil and liquids weighted projects during the year. We believe our valuation still reflects a gas weighted Company, but as we transition to a more balanced production profile this year, we hope that the value creation will be recognized in markets. We have a solid liquidity position that allows flexibility in our capital program, have a good and prudent hedging program in place that has locked in some very attractive oil prices. And I believe that this is an exciting time for us and for Crimson and the industry and looking forward to a great -- another great year. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Questions and Answers. OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Jeff Hayden with Rodman Renshaw. JEFF HAYDEN, ANALYST, RODMAN & RENSHAW: Hello, Allan, the Beeler #2 -- or excuse me, Beeler #1, I apologize, looks like you guys used 20 frac stages on that well. I guess a couple of questions, one, do you think you got all full 20 stages effectively? How did you complete it, use slick water or more like a cross-link gel on that well?. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, Jeff, I'm going to -- I'll let Carl, our Operations, Senior VP of Operations, address that question, okay?. CARL ISAAC, SVP OF OPERATIONS, CRIMSON EXPLORATION INC.: Can you repeat the question for me, Jeff?. JEFF HAYDEN: Yes, sure. I was just wondering did you get all 20 frac stages, do you think they were effective? Did you use slick water or more like a cross-link gel on that completion?. CARL ISAAC: We had 20 stages, they were all placed effectively. We had I think the 18th stage, we had indications of a screen out towards the very end. But generally speaking, we used what we would term a hybrid fluid system with about 20% slick water on average through the well, 20% linear gel through the well, and the balance in cross-link. We placed roughly 265,000, 280,000 pounds of sand per stage. Very similar to what other operators in the area have been doing. And all of that was placed at about 65 -- 60 to 65 barrels per minute in terms of rate. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, Jeff, I would also just say that there is a fair amount of activity around this, up there. We're -- the information is coming out slow up there, so we're taking a cautious approach in terms of how quickly we want to drill up there. We're still trying to determine what the -- we think that the way we frac these wells and the lateral length is optimum, but optimally, we want to learn from the industry as well. So we're monitoring that as well. JEFF HAYDEN: Okay. Then jumping over to your stuff in Karnes County, obviously EOG talked about some nice results, down spacing, et cetera, when they reported their earnings earlier this season. I guess what's the current thinking there, as far as what you guys are going to be able to get down to as far as eventual spacing. I think your presentation still shows an EUR range of 350 to 400 Mboes for that position is that conservative? Do you think that could go north?. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, I'll let Steve Mengle, our Senior VP of Engineering, address that question, Jeff. STEVE MENGLE, SVP OF ENGINEERING, CRIMSON EXPLORATION INC.: Jeff, which well were you referring to?. ALLAN KEEL: You're talking about Karnes County, it'd be the --. STEVE MENGLE: Oh, Karnes County. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, the -- whether the --. JEFF HAYDEN: Yes, just average spacing in EURs, where do you think they can go based on what you've seen from your results as well as industry activity in the area. STEVE MENGLE: Right now, the wells that we have drilled have been spaced on anywhere between about 800 and 1,000 foot. We do believe that at that spacing, we have room for in-fills in between. So, that would put us in the 400 to 500 foot range spacing ultimately. Although we don't have plans, we don't have in our capital budget for this year but we clearly see it here in the future. In terms of performance of the wells, they're remarkably consistent, and the EURs that we see are in the 350,000 to 400,000 barrel range, which with gas and NGLs puts you in the 400,000 to 450,000 Boe range. JEFF HAYDEN: Okay. I appreciate it, guys. ALLAN KEEL: Thanks, Jeff. STEVE MENGLE: Thanks, Jeff. OPERATOR: Steve Berman with Pritchard Capital Partners. STEVE BERMAN, ANALYST, PRITCHARD CAPITAL: Good morning, guys. Staying in Karnes for a second, can you talk a little bit more, Allan, about the tighter chokes? I mean did you see anything in the Littlepage declines that caused you any concern to experiment with tighter chokes or is this just a natural progression as you move through the play there?. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, now we've -- the Littlepage McBride results have been excellent. We just experimenting a little bit with a smaller choke here and we felt like we didn't really need to have any more high rate well announcement. So we decided to try to go a little bit lower sub size. We've got additional in-field drilling to do up here and we just wanted to see if this particular well, if we could see any impact on the initial declines with a smaller choke. STEVE BERMAN: Okay. The press release and the Vick Trust well says Woodbine, I think you said, Lewisville. Can talk a little bit about that versus the Woodbine, what expectations might be different? Are the wells going to cost less, et cetera?. ALLAN KEEL: No, it's -- yes, the Lewisville is really -- the Woodbine is a more of I'd say a generic term up there. The Lewisville is just a different sand load. It's a little bit different sand but it's all in the same general section as the Woodbine. The Woodbine, you can -- up there you have the A and B, C, sand and then the Lewisville is just a different terminology, as you move a little bit farther to the east in the play. It's just a different terminology, but it's in the same general stratigraphic section. But in terms of costs, it's the same, practically the same costs. It's -- this is the acreage that we acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, the 4,600 acres that we wanted to pick up. So, this is our first well over in that area. STEVE BERMAN: All right. Back to the Eagle Ford again, what are you seeing in terms of overall completion costs, any easing over there? Also, what are you getting for your oil down there these days?. ALLAN KEEL: Well, I know that we have seen some relaxing in some of the pumping costs. I'll let Carl address that and your other question there about what we're seeing for our oil, either Carl or Steve can chip in on that question. Carl?. CARL ISAAC: Yes, Steve, I think the short answer to your question is we're seeing well costs completed to the tanks in Karnes County, in the Eagle Ford, in between $7 million and $7.5 million. So there's obviously been some improvement there, some of that's from a design, engineering design standpoint of wellbores and the completion. Some of that's been some, I wouldn't say softening, I'd say flattening of some of the service markets that are obviously very pertinent to the overall total spend. So, hopefully that's a good answer to your question. STEVE BERMAN: What was the most expensive well you drilled there so far, just to get some perspective as to how much prices might have eased?. CARL ISAAC: The first well at Littlepage was the most expensive well at Littlepage. We had actually set a shallower string of pipe by design, because it was the first well into a field that hadn't been drilled in about 25 years. We're very focused on making sure that from an environmental and safety standpoint, that our wells are designed properly. So, once we got that first one stuck in the ground, and proved that we didn't have any shallow hazards to be concerned about, that opened the door for us to go on about our business. Very similar to the way the offset operators around us were. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, Steve, I would say that our initial well was probably close to $10 million. I think the last -- I think the last Glasscock well -- the first Glasscock well that we drilled was probably I'd call it $7.5 million, $8 million. CARL ISAAC: The Littlepage was in the $7.4 million -- $7.3 million, $7.4 million range. Average for the whole Littlepage lease was somewhere between $8.3 million and $8.5 million for all seven wells. That's the stability, the whole nine yards. STEVE BERMAN: And pricing, oil pricing?. STEVE MENGLE: Yes in Karnes County, specifically, because that's obviously, where obviously our [above oil] is coming from, that market has changed overtime when we first came on production. We didn't have access to the LLS market and -- for the first half of last year. Our pricing was based on WTI, and it was a slight discount, a few bucks discount to WTI. Because of the whole dynamics of the oil markets changed a little bit, we currently are getting -- our oil is priced on an LLS basis. We're currently getting LLS, less about $6, $6.75, something like that, which actually gives us then a premium to WTI. STEVE BERMAN: Okay, thank you, gentlemen. ALLAN KEEL: Thanks, Steve. OPERATOR: Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. RON MILLS, ANALYST, JOHNSON RICE & COMPANY: On the Woodbine area, you talked about drilling nine wells, although it sounds like you have two rigs, excuse me, in the area right now. Is the plan to maintain two rigs or are you going to get a few wells drilled and monitor results before you get going again? I'm just trying to go from the current rig count to your total well count and it seems like it's a little bit light. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, you nailed it, Ron. We're going to drill a couple of wells then monitor results. We'll drop back down to one rig up there pretty quickly. So yes, that's the plan. We'll probably run a one-rig program out there until we see the results of our initial drilling out there. So, that is the plan. RON MILLS: Okay and is there much difference in terms of the way you look at your plan of Woodbine versus Lewisville or are you going to drill any Georgetown wells? Because is the Georgetown opportunity in Madison Grimes, is that more of a conventional target or what are you going to be focused on?. ALLAN KEEL: We're going to be -- this year we're going to be focused on the Woodbine, and definitely the Georgetown is certainly something we've actually worked on the last few years. We've had quite a bit of work done on the potential of the Georgetown across our lease hold position. Good news is, an offset operator drilled the Georgetown well up there recently and had a very nice initial rate. We haven't been able to see the results since the announcement of the initial rate, but if that rate holds up, which we actually anticipate that it will, that's going to probably double. At least double our potential reserve estimate of that lease hold position up there, so it's -- we're very excited about that. That's -- but we don't have any plans at this time to drill a Georgetown well, we want to watch the other operators. Once the results of the wells that they've drilled up there in the Georgetown and -- but that's something we would certainly try to pursue in the next year's budget if it pans outs like we hope it will. RON MILLS: Okay. You guys, I know you provided first quarter production guidance and you talked about January exiting at about 40% liquids. In the fourth quarter, you were a little bit more than 50% of your liquids were oil. When you start to approach your 50/50 liquids mix, do you think the NGLs are going to increase as a component of that, or do you think that the current oil NGL split should remain fairly constant?. JOE GRADY: Yes, I think it is the other way, Ron. The oil is going to increase much more rapidly than any increase in the NGLs. So that percentage should go up. The percentage of oil to the oil liquids mix should go up. RON MILLS: Okay, good. I know the shift, and you talked about it earlier, Allan, the shift to the liquids production comes on at lower rates but much greater margins. You grew 20%-plus in 2011. Given the shift, are you targeting some sort of growth rate for 2012 on a volume metric basis? Trying to get a sense of the production ramp as we move through the rest of the year. ALLAN KEEL: Well, I would say that with the -- again, as we move toward the more liquids rich profile, that our rate is going to remain I would say flattish for the year, best -- I think that's the way to approach it. I mean in terms of our daily rate and our annual production numbers. I mean although we're not giving guidance to the rest of the year, but I mean I would say that generally given that these oil wells are lower rate type wells. I mean that's what I'd anticipate. Joe, do you have any comments about that?. JOE GRADY: Yes, Ron, I would agree with that. But as we've tried to indicate, that the percentage of oil and liquids is going to increase. So from a cash flow standpoint, even though production might remain flat for the year, that cash flow generation is going to increase meaningfully. RON MILLS: No, I agree. I just was -- wanted to make sure we were on the right lines. And one last --. JOE GRADY: When we were drilling Haynesville wells last year, and bringing those on at 15 million or 16 million a day, and equivalents. Now you're bringing on 1,000 barrel a day oil wells that are on an equivalent basis are 6 million a day, so --. RON MILLS: Right, no I mean I'd rather you're doing what you're doing. (laughter) Then lastly, in Zavala and Dimmit County area, you talked about increasing activity. I know Chesapeake and CML and others have been active down there, permitting has apparently increased down in that portion of the play. Are they -- are you also seeing more completion activity? Because I know there had been some earlier drilling but not as many wells completed, is that starting to ramp up? Is that something that you can help leverage what -- as you look to the later in the year, any plans you may have in that portion of the Eagle Ford?. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, you're right, Ron, they are increasing the completion activity up there. So, we're monitoring that closely. As I mentioned earlier, in our Dimmit County acreage which is right on the -- actually the Dimmit, Zavala County acreage it's right on the -- straddles the border, the county line there, an offset operator has recently drilled a nice [PUDed] well that IPed at 600 barrels a day. So that's another plus of having the acreage that's -- our acreage down there for the most part is HBP, so we're going to be monitoring that very closely. But yes I think as more information comes out on the completions and the results, hopefully that will translate into us being able to become more active up there. There's no question that the Eagle Ford is thick there. It's very porous. It's just a matter of finding the right recipe to get the oil out of the ground at an economic rate. So a lot of potential up there, we just got to figure out exactly what the best practice is to get it out of the ground. Some of the results, actually some of the results to the north of us have been pretty encouraging, so we're watching it very closely. RON MILLS: What did you say that rate was? Allan, what did you say that rate was on that offsetting activity?. ALLAN KEEL: On that Buda well?. RON MILLS: Yes. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, it was 600 barrels a day. RON MILLS: Okay, perfect. What were you going to say, Joe?. JOE GRADY: Ron, there's a -- one of the big operators right in our area has though 10 or 12 wells that they're going to be completing in the very near future, and they've permitted another 12 or 15 in and around us. So there's still optimism for the area for sure. We just -- we all have to work together to try to develop a best practices set of procedures to try to maximize that recovery. RON MILLS: Guys, thank you very much. ALLAN KEEL: Thanks, Ron. OPERATOR: Dan Morrison with Global Hunter. DAN MORRISON, ANALYST, GLOBAL HUNTER SECURITIES, LLC: To follow through on the Dimmit Zavala conversation, how does your acreage over there split out between the two areas? I know it's all in the same neighborhood, but it seems like there's a discussion about the two different areas as being a little bit different. How do you see your acreage split between --?. JOE GRADY: I think it's probably pretty close to half and half, Dan. DAN MORRISON: Okay. JOE GRADY: Could be $5 million or $7 million, or close, but it's pretty close to half and half. DAN MORRISON: Perfect. The Buda test, has there been anything else over there that's popped up that we should look for as other zones being targeted by offsets?. ALLAN KEEL: I think -- I haven't seen any other announcements or any results, but we kept hearing, in our KM Ranch area we heard over in Frio County, that a couple of operators had made some nice Buda wells. Then now over on our other acreage down in the, what we call the Tortuga-Booth area, or that's the acreage that's on the Zavala, Dimmit County line, just to the east of our acreage position. An operator has drilled at least one, and permitted two more, maybe drilling their second well now, Buda wells. It looks very encouraging. So we're definitely monitoring that as well. DAN MORRISON: Okay, thanks. ALLAN KEEL: Thanks, Dan. OPERATOR: Jeff Hayden with Rodman Renshaw. JEFF HAYDEN: Hello, guys, just sticking with the Dimmit, Zavala County discussion, what are your expectations on well costs for that area right now?. JOE GRADY: I think that we're looking at a $6 million to $6.5 million range. I think our last well was $7 million. Well, it hadn't been completed yet, but it will be $7 million when we do complete it, the KM Ranch #2. JEFF HAYDEN: Okay. Thanks, guys. ALLAN KEEL: Thanks, Jeff. OPERATOR: Eric Anderson with Hartford Financial. ERIC ANDERSON, ANALYST, HARTFORD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, INC.: Yes, good morning. I know it is early in the play for you in terms of the Woodbine. But I was looking at a presentation by Woodbine Acquisition Corp, who was the acquirer of your offset operator PetroMax. Back in January, they put out a piece that basically pointed out the fact they've had 100% success rate in the drilling that they've done in your area, with a 163% I think IRR. What caught my eye was that they're talking about going from a 180-acre spacing down to as low as 40 acres. Just wondered maybe if you could comment on that, if you're able to. STEVE MENGLE: Right now, first off, our Mosely well that we just got through drilling is in the same section of the Woodbine, that the Woodbine Acquisition has been drilling and a good portion of our acreage is. It's absolutely too early for us to tell. I think that we need to get a few more wells under our belt, understand exactly how these things are performing, looking at recovery factors and stuff like that. I won't say that they're wrong. I mean I think just like with the Eagle Ford and the down spacing, there's just a lot not known yet. But right now, we're looking at it more on probably 160-acre spacing and then we'll go from there. ERIC ANDERSON: Okay, fair enough. Then up to the James Lime, do you have any data points in terms of what some of the offset operators have been able to bring on in terms of their success?. ALLAN KEEL: Yes, there's some -- they've announced some results out there. Steve, you might want to give us some color on the production mix out there, or product mix, but it's very liquids rich. Steve, you may have some more comment about this on the product mix out there. STEVE MENGLE: Right. What we've seen so far is from an IP perspective, these wells IP in the $2 million to $4 million a day range. The initial condensate or yield has been in excess of 200 to 250 barrels per million. Then from an NGL perspective, you're probably looking at about 100 barrels per million is what the -- so that's where you're starting. What we need to see is, so where do you go from here, what does the -- what's the profile going to look like and ultimately what the cost is going to be. I think there's been some experimentation with frac design and stuff like that. I'm not sure that a lot of -- from a cost perspective, I'm not -- I think they put costs aside. Let's see how we make the rock work and then we will focus on costs later. That's why we're on the sidelines is, cost will matter here and we need to understand both parts. ERIC ANDERSON: But those wells are a lot cheaper than the Haynesville or the Bossier?. STEVE MENGLE: Absolutely, yes they're -- yes. ERIC ANDERSON: Okay. Thanks very much. ALLAN KEEL: Thanks, Eric. OPERATOR: Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. RON MILLS: Just on the spacing in Karnes County, if you're able to go down to 400- to 600-acre spacing. How many locations do you think that will add given that exclusive of down spacing you've pretty much developed that Littlepage area, correct?. ALLAN KEEL: Right. Probably another 8 to 10, 12 at the most. RON MILLS: Okay, that's it. Thank you. OPERATOR: Steve Berman with Pritchard Capital Partners. STEVE BERMAN: Allan, any change in your thoughts on your Niobrara position?. ALLAN KEEL: No, Steve, we're -- we actually, we were contacted by another operator up there who's trying to consolidate. They're not one of the bigger players, they just wanted to maybe come in and drill some additional D&J type wells. But in terms of the Niobrara, nothing new there. There has been some continuous activity up there, but we have not made any efforts to drill our own well up there in the near term. We're just watching and waiting to see what's the -- because it is HBP, what's the best route for us to get the most value for that acreage. STEVE BERMAN: Okay. Great, thank you. OPERATOR: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Keel for any additional remarks. ALLAN KEEL: I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on our call today and look forward to sharing our results from our wells that we're currently drilling in the near future. Look forward to speaking with you again soon. So thanks a lot. That concludes our call. []. CQ Transcriptions, LLC.\"\n",
            "1 b\"Q1 08/2009 Satyam Computer Services Limited Earnings Conference Call - Final. 13215 words. 18 July 2008. Voxant FD (FAIR DISCLOSURE) WIRE. FNDW. English. \\xc2\\xa9 Voxant Inc. All rights reserved. OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and good afternoon. This is the ChorusCall conference operator. Welcome to the Satyam Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of 2008-2009. As a reminder, for the duration of this presentation, all participant lines are in the listen-only mode and this conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Srinivas Vadlamani, the CFO of Satyam Computers. Thank you and over to you, Mr. Vadlamani. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI, CFO, SATYAM COMPUTER SERVICES LIMITED: Thank you, Rochelle. Good morning and good evening to you all and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. Joining me on this call are Raju and Ram from Satyam. Before we start the discussion, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements concerning our future growth prospects. Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties associated with our business. Please refer to our various periodic filings with the SEC for a description of such risks. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company. I now hand over the session to Raju. RAMALINGA RAJU, CEO, SATYAM COMPUTER SERVICES LIMITED: Thank you all for joining us on this call. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Satyam achieved an annual revenue run rate of INR10,000 crores. In Q1, we grew by 8.5% as per Indian GAAP. We were able to deliver this performance on the back of 3% volume growth, helped in part by rupee depreciation. This along with sustained operational efficiency led us to increase the operating margins in Q1, which we believe will bolster annual margin performance. For US -- our US GAAP revenue for quarter -- for the quarter was $637 million, a growth of 41% over -- year over year and a sequential growth of 4%. Earnings per ADS grew by 36% year over year and was $0.38. In Q1, we hosted more than 200 customer executives, some around the world at our customer summit. We will increase by their positive inclination towards [substance] transformational capabilities and we were pleased to note that many of them were aligned to enter into long-term sustainable partnerships. Q1 also [with nest] increased business activity in Asia Pacific and Middle East. Further, companies in Europe that were slow to embrace offshoring are now showing increased interest to capitalize on our global [early] model. These regions continue to promise [significant] growth going forward. Against the backdrop of a better margin performance and prevailing [products] rate, we are revising our guidance for our financial year 2009. Our consolidated US GAAP revenue(sic - see press release) is expected to grow between 32% and 34.1%. And EPS is expected to grow by 26.1% to 28.2%. We remain positive and confident about our ability to deliver the stated guidance notwithstanding the operational environment. For instance, in Q1 we had a loss of animation business in BPO, which led to lower-than-expected growth. Despite this, we delivered 3% volume growth. We believe that this loss of business was transient and is limited to Q1. We are yet to see clear and consistent signals emanating from the banking and financial service sector which continues to be fluid. However, the US economy has been impacted by high energy costs. Moreover, the US economy has been impacted by high energy costs and rising inflation. This scenario impacts the prospects of sectors such as retail and transportation where there is a greater need for higher operational efficiency in the near term. This we believe grows a fertile ground for transformational opportunities. This is especially true when near-term benefits can be demonstrated, although such projects require longer cycle times to the cautious nature of the market. We remain alert to these market dynamics and continue to focus on delivering high impact and significant benefits to our customers. We are pleased with our ability to respond to these opportunities with our extended capabilities to do our recent acquisitions such as Bridge Strategy Group and Nitor Global Solutions. In Q1, these efforts helped Satyam win three large deals. We were also, in specific instances, able to garner a higher share of our customer spending, which is reflected in the increase in customers with the run rate of $1 million, $5 million and $10 million. We are increased by the continued demand in enterprise applications market where we enjoy a dominant position. This, coupled with our investments in enhancing our global footprint and global delivery centers position us better to deal with the current volatility in the market. Finally, on the [map] front, attrition continues to trend downward. Our annualized attrition for the first quarter was among the lowest in the industry at 10.95%. At the same time, our associated numbers have increased to 51,643 as of June 30th. I'll now turn the floor over to Srinivas. Thank you very much. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Thank you, Raju. Our detailed financials have been posted on the website and I assume that most of you will have got an opportunity to go to the same. Raju shared with you some of the business highlights of the quarter and I will focus on the financial highlights. For the quarter, consolidated revenue grew 8.5% sequentially in rupee terms and EPS for the quarter was INR8.16 after factoring in rupees INR36 crores loss on forward and options contracts. Sequential volume growth for the parent company was 3% with stable pricing. EBITDA margins for the quarter improved by 133 basis points sequentially under consolidated Indian GAAP. The improvement in EBITDA was despite the 80 basis points impact on margins on account of higher visa cost. The improvement was driven by a 6.7% rupee depreciation on better cost management. Gross manpower addition in the parent company was 1,918 and net addition was 651, which includes 161 [pressures]. To align our [business] to providing industry practice, the best full computing offshore [addition] has been increased to 2,120 hours from 1,884 hours per annum effect of fiscal 2009. Parent companies cash and bank balances increased by 83 million during the quarter. CapEx for the quarter was 36 million. Gross manpower addition is expected to be between 14,000 to 15,000 during this year. Increments for the year have been finalized and are expected to be between 12% to 14% for our [associate] and between 3% to 4% for onsite associates. Our margins for the year are expected to improve by around 50 basis points. Turning to US GAAP, revenue for the quarter grew 3.9% sequentially and earnings per ADS grew 11.8%. The earnings per ADS and the US GAAP is after providing for $2.2 million on account of fringe benefit [tax on results]. Moving on the US GAAP numbers, I would like to throw some light on the accounting policy that we have for the linear accounting on the Indian GAAP and US GAAP. Since our reporting currency is Indian rupees, in the first stage only [write] in foreign currency are converted into Indian rupees and relate dividing on the data [advising]. This is revenue that is published in the Indian GAAP financials. The weighted average US dollar rate for the quarter is INR42.46. For US GAAP accounting, the year [end] revenue for the quarter is then reconverted into US dollar revenues using the simple average of [moving rate of] US Federal Reserve based on the US GAAP accounting requirements, which was, for this quarter, at INR41.55. Just to take an example, if we have US dollars under the revenue -- under the US dollar revenue, the same will be converted into Indian rupees at the rate prevailing on the data analyzing, say at INR42.46. This will give a revenue of INR4,246 under Indian GAAP. For the US GAAP, this revenue will be converted into US dollars using the simple average of non-bank rate of US Federal Reserve, which, in this quarter, happens to be INR41.55. This will imply that under the US GAAP, the revenue that will be shown will be $102.20. The net impact is that the $100 revenue is reflected as $102.2 under US GAAP because of the different exchange rates used. This is accounting policy that we have been following since the day we have been publishing the US GAAP results. In the [near] period, the difference between the two exchange rates has not been material. However, in this quarter, given the extreme volatility in the exchange rate [moment], the difference is 2.2%, which is impacting the reported revenues under US GAAP. Because of this accounting requirement under the US GAAP, revenue for the quarter is higher by $13.5 million compared to Indian GAAP. Adjusting for this accounting implication, revenue for Q1 is $624 million against our guidance of -- guidance range of $631.7 million to $634.8 million for Q1. The shortfall of $7.7 million from the lower end of the guided range is primarily because of the decline in our BPO revenues, which Raju was alluding to by $6.7 million, quarter on quarter, due to completion of some of the animation businesses. Moving on, the earnings per US for fiscal 2009 will be between $1.45 to $1.48, implying a growth of 16% to 18.4%. This earnings per US guidance is excluding the fringe benefit tax on results as the competition of tax involves a variables like the price on the data [resting] -- data of exercise with employee, et cetera, which are very difficult to predict. Thank you and now, we throw open the session to Q&A. Questions and Answers. OPERATOR: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Please note that all participants who have logged into this call are allowed to ask questions, and there is no specific priority for participants in India and the ones outside India. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). The first question is from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead. JOSEPH FORESI, ANALYST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Hello. My first question here is just on the year-over-year growth. Last year, your growth was obviously a lot better than what we're seeing this year. I was wondering if you can give us some idea of why it's down. Is that solely based on what's going on in the economy or are there other factors at work?. RAM MYNAMPATI, EVP AND COO, SATYAM COMPUTER SERVICES LIMITED: Yes, this is Ram Mynampati here. I think we will make some assumptions coming into the financial year about the state of the market and state of specific market segments that we are operating in such as banking and financial services and also the contribution from various regions such as US and the trends that we see in the markets in other regions. The guidance that we have given for the year, which is 24% to 26% is reflective of the market conditions prevalent at that time. Nothing more than that other than the conditions that we were to build with at that time. And there's no material change in the market conditions now compared to the conditions at which we entered this financial year. Beyond that, there is nothing materially different. JOSEPH FORESI: And then, just looking at the second half of the year, obviously your guidance calls for it to be a little more backend loaded. I was wondering if you can give us an idea of what gives you confidence that things are picking up. Is it in -- do you think that the economic conditions are going to pick up or -- and what's your visibility on that?. RAM MYNAMPATI: Well, first of all, we'd just like to make a statement or two on the future guidance. Number one, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year, which is at 24% to 26%. And we're also saying that our Q2 guidance is about 4.5% for US GAAP. That implies that the guidance for Q3 and Q4, to maintain the annual guidance, is roughly in the order of about 5%. So, there is no specific backended nature to our guidance for the year. We are expecting fairly consistent and uniform performance for the next three quarters. So, there is not a whole lot of backended aspects to our guidance, number one. Number two, as we look at the markets, while there are markets that are volatile and dynamic as is the case with capital markets business, there are markets that continue to do well. We are doing reasonably well in insurance. We are doing well in retail and transportation. We are doing well in certain segments of manufacturing such as aerospace and defense. Telecom and media businesses are doing well. So broadly, there is a fairly positive environment outside of the financial services market. And even in the financial services market, while organizations are challenged to deliver business performance, we are also seeing the current environment providing the opportunities of a transformational kind where we are able to deliver immediate and near-term value to our customers. So, we are seeing a significant resonance from our customers in those instances where we are able to articulate the right value proposition. So, if you put all these things into the mix and analyze the growth prospects, we feel fairly comfortable with our annual guidance for the rest of the year. JOSEPH FORESI: Okay. And then, just on that 4.5% sequential growth, when you went in and gave guidance for the March quarter, what exchange rate were you expecting?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: You are saying when we gave in April the guidance?. JOSEPH FORESI: No, in March because I guess you guys have said in the release and kind of taken out the numbers, it looks like sequential growth is about 1% if you include the translation -- or I mean -- yes, the translation gain of about $13.5 million. If you exclude it, then you get the 4.5% growth based on the guidance in June. So, what I guess my question was -- what were you expecting in the March quarter as far as a translation rate?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: We were -- we had guided in April when we gave the guidance, we have a [June with] INR40 per dollar. There is assumption on which the guidance has been given. JOSEPH FORESI: So, was there a revenue shortfall because you needed the extra gain to make the quarter?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, there is. As I was mentioning in my speech, there is -- if you take the -- whatever the exchange rate -- if you -- when we remove the accounting differences, the dollar number comes to $624 million. So, $624 million, now we are guiding that for Q2. The -- it will go up to $652 million. So, that is how we are arriving at that 4.5%. For awhile, if we kind of take into account the [13.5], because it arose because of the accounting and because of that, our Q1 revenues go up to $637 million. So, some $637 million, which is a reported number and which is a GAAP number, some $657 million, if we are growing to $652 million in [apparent] of the range, the growth rate is 2.3%. So, it is basically a difference on how we are going to look at it. So, if we look at it from $624 million, then the organic growth -- that is in built is around 4.5%. But since this is an accounting issue and the GAAP number -- publish the GAAP number is $637 million, if we are looking at from $637 million, the growth rate for Q2 comes to 2.3%. JOSEPH FORESI: Sure. I understand that. But that $624 million is below your initial guidance for the March quarter, correct?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, that is -- yes, below by around $7.7 million. The lower end of the range we have given is $631.7 million. So, if you -- if we look at $624 million, then it is lower by $7.7 million. That is primarily because of the animation business going away in certain BPO. That is a primary contributor for that. JOSEPH FORESI: Okay. Okay. And then just lastly, real quickly. You decided to change, I guess, the hours in which you look at your pricing, which brings -- which obviously causes a change in the rate. Could you just give us the reason for the changing of the hours at this point again?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, it won't impact any change in the rates [or whatever]. Nothing to do with the billing rates, just that the [luring] factor, the utilization rate we are reporting will come down. That is what has happened in this quarter. The offshore utilization rate is right now at around 74%, 75%, adding an [initial percent]. This is primarily because our associate, we have taken the available of us in a year out at 2,120, which is basically the industry practice. So, this is one of the -- in fact, the request from the analyst community to -- just to have that comparison with some of the industry peers to take a comparable number. So then, we have basically seen the industry practice. We found that most of the companies take the denominator anywhere between 2,050 to 2,150. So -- and then accordingly reported luring factor. So accordingly, we part that we will move there rather than taking our traditional number of 1,884, which basically inflates the luring factor number. So right now, whatever luring factors we are reporting this quarter is basically comparable with some of the luring factor published there, thus. JOSEPH FORESI: Okay. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Foresi. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). The next question is from the line of Mr. Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research. Please go ahead. TRIP CHOWDHRY, ANALYST, GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH: Yes. Thank you. I was just wondering like the way I see and the way our research is in [beginning], until and unless the oil prices fall to $25 a barrel, the tech sector will continue to struggle to recover and probably that may take two years of extreme torture, basically. So in that situation, where the price of oil doesn't fall to $25 a barrel and the IT spend environment continues to be excruciating, who do you think Satyam -- what strategies can Satyam have to sustain itself for the next two years of turmoil here? Thank you. RAMALINGA RAJU: Well, I am not sure -- this is Raju here. I am not so sure if I would agree with that type of [assist]. The manner in which value is getting created for companies today is significantly determined by the knowledge aspects of creating that value. Which essentially means that there is a greater role for organizations like Satyam to play in bringing about that transformation value for companies. As the mature platforms are becoming more and more robust and affordable, one can expect that there is a greater role of -- for companies to play in influencing change in organizations. The proportion of [success] in the global GDP is also growing. So at that generic level, I am not so sure if the only significant factor influencing the growth opportunities is around energy and related matters. Now, while that is having a general important impact on the global economy, there are various other opportunities that come the way of -- for companies like Satyam. So, we are quite bullish about the opportunities for the [augmentation]. In a three to five-year perspective, I have absolutely no doubt in stating that the growth opportunities arising out of larger deals, transformational services and so on and so forth would be quite high. Therefore, I don't see a gloom scenario that you seem to envision. TRIP CHOWDHRY: Thank you and all the best. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Chowdhry. The next question is from the line of [Triaro Hira] from [Manam] Securities. Please go ahead. TRIARO HIRA, ANALYST, MANAM SECURITIES: Yes, good evening to the management team and congratulations on a good set of numbers. I would like to throw some idea on the -- how do you see the manufacturing building going through? We've seen some of the impact from US slowdown on the [building end, while tool] manufacturing domain. And [trying] to combine this with how you do you see this in the enterprise space where you continue to lead the growth?. RAM MYNAMPATI: Yes, this is Ram Mynampati here. As I was alluding to in the earlier remarks, different market segments obviously are reacting and internalizing the impact of the dynamics of the market differently and manufacturing is no different in that, there are multiple sectors that we operating in manufacturing. There is the automotive sector that we are engaged in. There is the aerospace and defense sector. There's process manufacturing sector. There are a host of some market segments that consist of the broader manufacturing practice. And within that, as you can imagine, certain sectors like automotive are not doing very well, particularly in the US market where automotive sector is challenged quite dramatically, not only due to the price of oil, but due to the complicated nature of the market and the shift in buying pattern of the consumers, the clear shift in priorities and preference. But at the same token, there are sectors like aerospace and defense. That market is doing very well and not just in the US, but we see significant traction in other markets such as the Middle East, such as Asia Pacific. So, depending on the extreme at which you are operating in the manufacturing sector, the market segments looks different and attractive. But in the broader manufacturing sector, we remain fairly upbeat and positive notwithstanding the selective segments like automotive that are probably not going to do very well for awhile. TRIARO HIRA: So then, would it be correct to assume that a bulk of the [dancing deeds] which, you know, in pipeline for you are more largely in this space compared to the core auto segment?. RAM MYNAMPATI: Well, if you're asking specifically about the manufacturing sector, yes. But there are transformation opportunities. There are plenty across sectors other than manufacturing and we see those in retail, pharmaceuticals and life science sales, transportation, even in financial services market. So, I think it's fair to say that if you are willing to invest the time to unearth transformational opportunities that can create near-term tangible value for the customers, you can find them in every market segment. The other part of your question which is on the enterprise solution space, we continue to see fairly strong pipeline and enterprise solutions and we don't see any slowdown either in services related opportunities, implementation customization opportunities and global rollout of specific products and services. And we believe that our strength in this market certainly would enable us to deliver greater value to our customers not only in the manufacturing sector, but even in other manufacturing -- other sectors where hopefully the applications are a strong suite. TRIARO HIRA: Sure. And I can just take this one question. What sort of net additions are you looking at for the full year?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Hira, we generally do [maintenance] on the [glass] additions. So, we are basically saying 14,000 to 15,000 we will [grant] additions in this year. TRIARO HIRA: And the bulk of it come in the second quarter given that the first quarter had 651 odd?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, I mean, it will be -- those will be joining in the next three quarters and the timing of it will depend upon the overall business requirements. TRIARO HIRA: Sure. Thanks very much and wish you all the best. OPERATOR: Thank you, Ms. Hira. The next question is from the line of Mr. Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. Please go ahead. ROD BOURGEOIS, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN: Great. Hi, guys. Just in terms of the first part of my question, can you clarify what has happened in the BPO unit, specifically in the animation business and can you clarify if that business is permanently gone or is that a temporary situation?. RAMALINGA RAJU: And I -- just that from a sizable contract got concluded and did not get extended for the given period and then it is being resumed again and therefore, this is not a permanent loss and we expect that business to be as usual. ROD BOURGEOIS: Okay, great. And then, just to clarify a couple of things in your guidance, did you mention that you're guiding to 50 basis points of margin expansion now for fiscal '09?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, Rod. The EBIT margin, we're expecting a 50 basis points improvement. And as you know in the beginning of the fiscal, we guided that EBIT margin will decline by 50 basis. So that way, we are basically seeing 100 basis points improvement overall in the EBIT level. ROD BOURGEOIS: So, you're planning to basically give the shareholder back some of the benefit from the rupee depreciation, but still are having some room to reinvest some of the rupee margin benefit back into the business?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, absolutely. We will be blowing back some [profit] into the business. ROD BOURGEOIS: Okay. Great. And then, the other question about the guidance, you're keeping your full-year guidance intact, but you've just had a significant miss in the BPO unit. Does that mean that you're IT services unit is seeing a better outlook now than it was three months ago?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, I mean, but then when you look at, on a year-on-year basis, it all depends on how the BPO business pans out in the next three quarters. So at least at this juncture, our expectation is that BPO will also pick up. And from that point of view, what we anticipated in the beginning of the year, for some time BPO will [rectify]. So, from that point of view, I mean, we can see -- that is what we are expecting at this point in time. ROD BOURGEOIS: Okay. All right. Great. And then, can you also comment on the increase in unbilled receivables? It was up again this quarter and, from my perspective, that pattern makes sense given the ramp up you've had in large deals over the last year. But can you give us a sense for maybe what types of contracts are causing unbilleds to continue to rise and when the unbilled receivable pattern might start to subside here?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: This is again this 93 basis receivable [base 86]. So, roughly around a couple of days -- two to three days. In fact, it's primarily because of again exchange because the closing dollar rate is INR43.03 -- INR43.03. So, that is how we will convert the closing debtors. And then calculate the [debtor] days. So from that point of view, the debtor days appear to be a little higher. So, add in 93 days, it is actually 91 days if you for awhile nullify the exchange fluctuation. So, even then there is a duration quarter on quarter. I basically don't see a trend anytime that we expect this to -- we want -- we expect this to pull back in the next few quarters. ROD BOURGEOIS: You said you expect DSOs to pull back and also unbilled receivables or just DSOs overall?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Both. Both we are expecting them to come back to, in the case of unbilled revenue to the [flare on] $80 million or so. And then in the case of the total days, we are anywhere between 85 to 90. That is the range we have been. I think we will come back to that range. ROD BOURGEOIS: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Bourgeois. The next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. JAMES FRIEDMAN, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP: Hi. Thank you. Srinivas, I just wanted to clarify again -- so previously, you had guided for fiscal year '09 operating margins to decline 50 basis points. And now, are you saying that there will be a 50 basis point increase?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. Yes, James. That is what we are saying. JAMES FRIEDMAN: And how should we be modeling the operating margin for the second fiscal quarter?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Sorry. I didn't get it. JAMES FRIEDMAN: What's your margin for 2Q is. What should we model for a 2Q margin?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, I mean, James, we generally don't give guidance at the operating margin level. I can only just say that in Q2, we expect the operating margins to decline. This is primarily because of the increments that will kick in effective 1st of July. So otherwise overall for the year, that gets evened out and we will still be able to achieve that 50 basis points improvement. But this quarter-on-quarter operation I think we have to put up with it because of the specific event of increment that is happening. JAMES FRIEDMAN: My next question's with regard to your constant currency comments. What is effectively the reconciliation of the translation of the $13 million, the effect from functional to reporting? That's much more detailed than some of your competitors report. Most of the Indian vendors don't report a constant currency. I guess what was it -- and historically I don't remember Satyam reporting constant currency either. My question is what leads you to give that disclosure at this time?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, this is, as I was mentioning in my earlier comments, this is primarily earlier, but also these differences were there. Just again clarify, we have been devoting years. We have members for the last seven, eight years and the accounting policy remains the same. In fact, this is not our policy. It is basically US GAAP policy. There's a regulation called SK, which basically describes the -- this kind of accounting rule. So, we are following that. The only thing is rupee never fluctuated so volatiley in this quarter, like in this quarter. So because of that, there were differences, but the difference were not as high as say, NRI0.90. In this case, it is NRI42.46 to NRI41.55. It is almost NRI0.90. Whereas earlier quarters it is to be a small number of NRI0.20 to NRI0.30. So because of that, maybe it is not so evident and so significant. Whereas this quarter, it so happened that it became a very significant number. That is the reason why we have to disclose that in order [to link]. JAMES FRIEDMAN: Okay. And then, my last question is -- and that's very helpful, Srinivas. My last question is for Ram. Ram, you occasionally give a strategic deal count. I think last you had mentioned 15 to 20 in the pipeline. Could you give some commentary on how many might have closed and what the pipeline looks at this point for strategics? Thanks. RAM MYNAMPATI: Sure, Jamie. We have won about three deals this quarter and the pipeline consists of roughly about 20 or so of the strategic deals. The pipeline looks reasonable healthy and we are foreseeing opportunities across market segments, across geographies, across services lines, pretty much representative to sample of the type of opportunities that we have been pursuing. So, the data [counsels] are three deals that we have one in Q1 and there are about 20 in the pipeline. JAMES FRIEDMAN: Thank you. That's helpful. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Friedman. The next question is from the line of Mr. George Price from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. GEORGE PRICE, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Thanks very much. Personally, for what it's worth, I think I and a lot of people would be happy with oil sales at $100. I'm not sure, but I'm going to wait around for $25. But thanks for taking my question. First is a clarification to a couple of the prior questions. The impact of currency to revenue in the first quarter, you're basically indicating revenue otherwise would have been amiss given what happened with -- in the BPO unit. And that this treatment has been consistent with the past. Didn't we have a big move in the rupee back in the March 2007 quarter and the rupee actually went the other way? I think that would have been a benefit at that point. Because you haven't really discussed this issue up until now, which is noted. But I think we had a similar level of volatility just moving the other way a little over a year ago. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Again, this -- yes, I agree with you. It happened in Q1 of last year. But then again, how did it happen? Whether it panned out evenly over the quarter or it happened in the beginning of the quarter or at the end of the quarter. So, these are some of the things which, when we made a study, in fact, in that quarter, the volatility, the difference of NRI0.90, which I'm referring to is only NRI0.50. So from that point of view, it is that much insignificant. So, I mean, these differences are there, but these are again, I think, some of these things we have to put up with it when we are reporting in two different GAAPs and two different currencies, conversions, accounting rules. So, that is what is causing this confusion. And also, the way rupee appreciates or depreciates, all those things and how -- in what duration it appreciates or depreciates, whether it happened over the period of time or it happened in a few days. All these things are having an impact. GEORGE PRICE: Okay. One question which is on the cash flow statement. You had a -- you had $53 million in unrealized gain on derivative financial instruments in the quarter and it's a line item that just, on quick check, I don't think we've seen in past quarters. Can you comment on exactly what that is? It's -- on the comparison periods, there were more modest losses. What drove that large benefit? How should we think about timing of cash flow maybe over the next couple quarters? Any one-time issues like that?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: I -- can you repeat that, please?. GEORGE PRICE: Srinivas, there's was a $53 million unrealized gain in the cash flow statement and I'm just wondering if you could explain that in a little bit more detail -- through over the magnitude of that. I haven't seen that line item over the last couple of quarters. Maybe I missed it, but I don't think I have seen it. It just -- it's a -- the magnitude is a little surprising. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, let me -- let me check on that. I'll get back to you. GEORGE PRICE: All right. Well, let me ask one more question then. I wondered if you could just comment on -- a little bit on client mindset. You -- maybe BFSI specifically, but also in general. What's the tone in spending over the next six months, maybe now vis-a-vis the beginning of the year? Are budgets still being spent? Are you seeing any uptick in cancellations and deferrals? Are you seeing any clients coming back to try and renegotiate contracts that maybe they only signed one or two years ago?. RAM MYNAMPATI: Yes, this is Ram Mynampati here. I would say at a broad level, every one of these things is happening in some way or fashion, but not to such an extent to have a materially different point of view than what we came into the financial year with. We expected BFS to be slower. And it is, it turned out to be exactly that. We expected some markets to be continuing to be attractive and then, we see action and good pipeline in many of the market segments. As far as the mindset of the clients is concerned, I think we have to maybe differentiate between BFS and other markets only because BFS clients are probably more directly impacted by what's happening in the [capped] markets in addition to the broader impact in the market. But in general, what we are seeing in clients, including BFS, is if there is a value proposition that brings near-term benefit, that includes cost out, includes operational efficiencies, includes a better way of doing things and creating [constant] impact, we get the year of the decision maker. That has been a clear sign in the last quarter. [It owns] on us to go back to the client with specific opportunities that the proposition, that benefits the client and us. Second, while there is very little talk about gifts today, there is a greater desire to extend the budgets farther than what -- if they would have gone earlier. So, clients are very anxious to explore ways and means of driving to greater benefit and greater efficiency. That is probably the common theme that we hear across market segments. And there are customers that are fairly broad and global in their footprint, they continue to invest in strategic initiatives notwithstanding the challenge in the market. And we stay engaged with them and not just in the North American market, but in other regions as well. And while they are aware of the market dynamics, they continue to progress on the investments that they have made. So all in all, the markets and the clients' sentiment that we are seeing today is probably in line with what we expected to see coming into the financial year and that's the reason why we are fairly confident about diluting the guidance for the year today as much as we were in the beginning of the year. GEORGE PRICE: Just to make sure I understand one of your comments, you said very little talk of budgets today, a greater desire to extend budgets beyond what they are today. Does that -- is that just clients want to make better use of their dollars and therefore are looking for lower cost alternatives, more efficient alternatives, i.e. offshore, or are they actually trying to get more money funneled in to actually raise their budgets. I just want to understand. RAM MYNAMPATI: It is the former, not the latter use. You put it better than me. GEORGE PRICE: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Price. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Just to clarify [where there are doubts] on that $56 million, that is basically because of the losses that we have incurred because of this follower hedging contracts. So, that is the -- that is a loss and we also have a gain of roughly around $45 million or so. Net-net there is an impact of roughly around $8 million. That is what we are seeing in the P&L. That is translation [36 close into P terms] and in dollar terms, it is around $8.8 million. So, that figure which you are referring to relates to our hedging contracts and losses. OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. The next question is from the line of Mr. Kunal Sangoi from Edelweiss. Please go ahead. KUNAL SANGOI, ANALYST, EDELWEISS: Yes, hi. Can you just, over your comments on the pricing, how has been the pricing scenario in the recent bills that you've won?. RAM MYNAMPATI: Kunal, this is Ram Mynampati. Pricing has been fairly stable if you look at our average prices between Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year. You will notice that both onsite and offshore prices remained largely in the same range. So, we have been seeing fairly stable pricing environment overall. While you would also have one odd client coming in at a higher-than-average prices and one odd client expressing a desire to get to a lower price. But what we are seeing on an average is a fairly stable pricing environment and we expect the pricing to be there, the current levels are for the year. KUNAL SANGOI: All right. Also, there has been only one instance of client deciding to have lower prices or are other clients also looking at that?. RAM MYNAMPATI: I said one odd. That doesn't mean only one. KUNAL SANGOI: Okay. Sure. Okay. Second question is with regards to the client in that six to 10 bracket, yes, so basically, if I look at the growth rate, it has been by -- just 0.6% or -- so what has been -- is there some account which is probably ramping down or --?. RAM MYNAMPATI: Well, as we have stated a few times in the previous earnings calls, the top 10 client list or, for that matter, any client list is not a static set of clients that we continue to monitor. We did revenue by client in a given quarter and we order them in descending order and the top 10 happens to be the 10 clients that formed that group. So, there will always be churn within the top 10 or top five clients. So, it need not necessarily mean that one or two clients in the top 10 group have de-grown or whatever. There will always be a constant churn of clients that constitute top 10 group. So, there are clients that perhaps were not in the top 10 that have grown significantly faster than other clients so they find themselves in top 10. And some other clients would not have grown as much. So this churn happens all the time. So --. KUNAL SANGOI: Yes. RAM MYNAMPATI: -- [might as well] lead into it. KUNAL SANGOI: Sure. Okay. Mr. Srinivas, a question to you. With regards to [some weak debtors], you've seen that particularly -- that number has gone up. So is this just an operation or how -- what is the reason probably?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, it is basically a quarter-on-quarter operation. We will be pulling it back to 85 to 90 range very soon. So right now, it is around 93 days. So it will -- we will try to bring it back. VIJU GEORGE, ANALYST, EDELWEISS: Yes. Just a couple of questions very quickly. Viju George here. Can you give us a sense of how the margins would shape up on the Indian GAAP consolidated basis? Would that also be climbing up 50 basis points up from last year?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. That is 50 -- the EBIT operating margin level, they will go up by 50 basis points. At the beginning of this year, we said that they will -- they actually decline by 50 basis points. But now, we are changing that to 50 basis points improvement. VIJU GEORGE: Okay. The other question I had pertains more to the timing of this [deeper] deal that did not come to or was pulled off. When did management get that sense in the quarter that this was not happening? That's point number one. Point number two is that what gives the assurance that you'd be able to still need your guidance in case these things do come?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: I mean, these things, as you know, keep happening and when we give the guidance, we basically look on these perimeters and various possibilities and we will do basically cash analysis and other. But sometimes things may not happen the way we anticipate. So, I will put it as one of those events. So otherwise now -- from now on, what our guidance we are given, since we have taken stock of the situation and committing these numbers, we are fairly confident of achieving these numbers. VIJU GEORGE: Okay. Thank you and all the best. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Sangoi. The next question is from the line of Mr. Sandeep Shah from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead. SANDEEP SHAH, ANALYST, ICICI SECURITIES: Yes. On this BPO, I just wanted to check how much animation does [percentage] to the BPO revenue go on the books?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: That basically is around 25% to 30%. It is again from quarter to quarter. But roughly, anywhere between 25% to 30%. SANDEEP SHAH: Yes, because you said that actually the loss to the guidance is as becoming to animation business loss. And if you look at the quarter, [the rate] on the BPO is roughly, $18 million, $20 million. So, it's seems like 40% to 50% of the revenue within BPO is coming through animation client. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, no. It is not 40% to 50%. It is roughly -- it varies quarter to quarter. So, it is roughly around 25% to 30%. SANDEEP SHAH: Secondly, [servo] computer also like -- there is no change in terms of their actually illustrate when they're reporting any odd numbers as relates to US GAAP revenue dollar number. So, is it like this policy is reminded to you or is it [communicate] to you or how does it work?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, it is definitely US GAAP requirement, so it is mainly [three]. So, it is not our policy as such. So, we need to -- each Company situation may vary and the differences may not be that much. So -- and if their differences are not that glaring and that significant, then some of these things may not come out. But again, the -- each Company situation I think we need to look at it differently. SANDEEP SHAH: Okay. And if you assume that this delinquent $5 million, as you said, is being a book entry, so in that sense going forward it seems like the guidance assumes a 5.75% growth quarter on quarter in the third and the fourth quarter was this guidance of 4.5% in the second quarter. So, as Mr. Ram said, this is not backended, but it seems like that the third and fourth quarter guidance growth rates is higher than the second quarter. So, what is the assurance that we are building into [windows] of our growth? Historically, a weak quarter in Q3 and Q4. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: In fact, when we are looking at -- from the Indian GAAP angle, Indian GAAP consolidated angle, there is no impact to part of any of these translation related issues. So from that point of view, if you look at our Indian GAAP guidance, the guided range for Q2 implies a growth of 4.7% to 5.7%. So, this is basically the -- under Indian GAAP. With the gain -- because of the gain translation exchange issues, translates to 3.5% to 4.5%. There is again within the growth also, if you are on that basis. So, if we stay with Indian GAAP consolidation, so 5.7% is the upper end of the guidance we were given. And assuming we achieve it, then definitely for Q3 and Q4, the asking rate will be in the range of 5%. So if we achieve over Q2 numbers under Indian GAAP consolidation, relatively the upper end of the range, then the asking rate for Q3 and Q4 is only 5%. Then, we will be home. SANDEEP SHAH: Actually, I was asking in dollar terms like not in the rupee terms under the US GAAP. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, dollar terms also same. Dollar terms also if you look at then this -- whatever the guidance we are given for Q2, if we achieve it, then the asking rate for the rest of the quarters is again at 5% only, even under US GAAP. SANDEEP SHAH: Okay, because I was getting 5.75%. Okay. I will check back and come back to you on the same. Thanks in all of this. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: You're welcome. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Shah. The next question is from the line of Mr. Arvind Ramnani from Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead. ARVIND RAMNANI, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to find out about your effective tax rates for '09 and 2010. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: This year, we expect the tax rate to be around 12% over EBIT. And next year also it may be around that. That would be a marginal increase, but not definitely very significant. It will be hovering around 12% to 12.5%. ARVIND RAMNANI: Okay. Great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Ramnani. The next question is from the line of Mr. [Santana Chrisnin] from [Stock Capital]. Please go ahead. SANTANA CHRISNIN, ANALYST, STOCK CAPITAL: I just had a question regarding [the debt off]. Like you reported a quarterly loss this quarter. Is there any particular issue with this particular subsidiary?. RAMALINGA RAJU: There's no particular issue specifically. As you see, revenue is certainly better than the last quarter. So, we see growth. But profitability sometimes depends on the expenses that are incurred in a given quarter. There is nothing that is worth focusing on. SANTANA CHRISNIN: Just to add onto this, is there any particular plans, big issues that you face in any other [articles] -- a little bit banking or [plans] issued in terms of ramp up or in terms of project related? Do we have any such issues? Did we experience any such issues during the quarter?. RAMALINGA RAJU: Well, again, this quarter is no different than any other quarter in that which we service 600 odd clients. There will always be issues so that some clients or the others. I don't know whether this quarter is any different than any other quarter. But there's issues that are so material that would make a difference to our business, I would not think that this quarter is any different. So, I don't want to say that there are no issues with any client, that will happen every quarter with some client or the other, given the number of clients that we service. So, we just happen to focus on it this quarter only because of the environment surrounding that. But from an operating environment perspective, I don't think this quarter is any different than any other quarter. SANTANA CHRISNIN: And just one last question, do we have any -- did we have any deals during the quarter where we have sold crossover some of our new services to the customers, something like bundling the beans and selling to new customer?. RAM MYNAMPATI: On thing I must say on the positive side of this quarter is that we are able to very successfully integrate and extend our services leveraging the new partners within Satyam and new acquisitions such as brief strategy as Raju was talking about. We are able to reach into the higher executive levels in many of the customers that we are engaged with, particularly leveraging the confidence and [strategy] in this and [we]. So, that is a very positive side. That means we are able to sell not only our core and organic services, but we are able to leverage the presence of companies like Bridge to extend our reach and to be decision makers on the business side as well beyond technology. It's a very positive sign and we expect to see many more of these the rest of the year. SANTANA CHRISNIN: Sure. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Chrisnin. The next question is from the line of Mr. Ashish Thadhani from Gilford Securities. Please go ahead. ASHISH THADHANI, ANALYST, GILFORD SECURITIES: Yes. Good evening. A couple of questions. On the revenue side this quarter, what was the acquisition contribution? And second is, after the BPO setback, what is your fiscal '09 outlook for this subsidiary? You've shared this with us in the past. And then finally, on the margin side, it appears that you have net hedging loss of $8.8 million and I was wondering what the offsetting translation gain was at the operating income level. Thank you. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Just to take your last question, the [phonics] translation gains and losses is not impacting the -- either the top line or the operating line. This is basically taken as other income. So, this $8.8 million comes as other income as a loss. So, that way it won't impact our operating perimeters at all. And coming to your question on the acquisitions, how much they contributed, roughly now the only subsidiaries while we will not be able to give company-wise, the only subsidiaries put together have added around 94 gross to our top line, which translates to roughly around $20 million this quarter. That is what is contribution from all the subsidiaries put together. ASHISH THADHANI: Do you have a specific outlook for Nipuna for the fiscal year?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. I mean, we have our internal targets and also we expect even the Satyam BPO or now the name has been changed to Satyam BPO to do well and we have the right management in place and we have the right customer base and it is basically in a take-off stage and we expect Satyam BPO to do well in this year, while we will not be able to give any guidance because we, as a corporation, give at a consolidated entity level, not at unusual Company levels. So keeping that in view, I mean, we expect Satyam BPO to do well in this -- in this fiscal. ASHISH THADHANI: And Srinivas, organics quarter-on-quarter growth rate?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: I mean, basically, again, I mean, this -- whatever growth rate we have achieved of 3.9% in US dollar terms is the consolidated [development]. And I mean, if you look at only the organic growth, I don't have that number really, but roughly $20 million is contributed by the subsidiaries. ASHISH THADHANI: Do you say that the acquisitions that you announced in the last quarter, what was the incremental impact of that on this quarter?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: The impact of all the acquisitions we announced in the last quarter, only one acquisition, the Bridge Strategy, the Bridge Consulting Group, has been consolidated into our accounts and that contributed around $7 million. ASHISH THADHANI: $7 million. Okay. And one final, if I may. Just wanted a clarification on this utilization. The increase in hours for computing utilization. Are the employees actually working more hours and being compensated for the difference or that is not the case?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: In fact, that is the case. And in fact, in terms of -- again, I would like to clarify here that is whatever change we have affected is only for offshore, not onsite. Onsite remains at eight hours per day, which we have been following. When it comes to offshore, we have basically against the higher denominator. This is primarily to fall in line with industry practice of taking 2,120 per year. So otherwise, what -- if we continue to take 1,884, then our utilization levels may look very high and not comparable with some of the others. So this is basically one of the requests analysts just to bring that double-double comparison so that is the reason why we have done this. But it doesn't impact the onsite at all. This is purely for offshore. ASHISH THADHANI: And the employees are being compensated for the full difference or are you sharing some of that with the Company? Basically working more or less?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. I mean, basically, in India we don't have this concept. The working -- the official working hours for September example is nine hours per day. This has been the practice for the last now four to five years. Whereas for a competition of learning factors we were taking eight hours per day. So accordingly we heard that we will also change the denominator. So from that point of view, there is no additional liability or anything on the Company because of this. ASHISH THADHANI: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: You're welcome. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Thadhani. The next question is from the line of [Netia Thomas] from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. JULIO QUINTEROS, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hi. Actually, it's Julio Quinteros from Goldman on the same line here. I want to come back to this -- the BPO business that you guys have been in for some time now. Satyam BPO. What is the plan here and at what point do you guys really take a harder look on whether it's necessary to be in a business that continues to be a drag and quite frankly doesn't appear to be adding much in the way of value to shareholders? Can you just talk about how much longer we're going to be looking at this situation before some other decision is made?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: In fact, Julio -- is this Julio?. JULIO QUINTEROS: It is Julio. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Okay. Basically, if you look at last year, the performance of Satyam BPO -- in fact, it did fairly well. It was very positive for the financial year '08. And also the net profit level has made a marginal loss of around $5 million. And [to see] of while we have kind of a blip in this portal in Q1, but for the entire year we expect Satyam BPO to be a bit positive and also a relative breakeven at the net level. So in fact we characterize this year as a take-off year, as a turning point in the history of Satyam BPO. So we don't really have any concerns whatsoever on the business model or on the prospects for this particular company. JULIO QUINTEROS: Okay. And then one other thing and if we take the $7 million contribution that you disclosed for acquisitions, adjust for the $13.5 million reported on the revenues, we're really looking at about flat sequential revenue growth on an organic basis. Is that the correct way to look at that?. RAMALINGA RAJU: There are a few things to be taken into consideration. At the fact that the Bridge Strategy Group has -- it came into the Company. We're operating at a much lower revenue level. Therefore there is an enhancement in -- on the operations on account of the synergies that we have been able to realize coming together. Therefore it would not be an accurate representation to say that this reflects any significantly lower performance for the quarter on account of taking -- not taking the position numbers into account. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: In fact, if you look at the -- this is what I'm saying that if we -- if this is Srinivas here -- if we look at the overall contribution from all subsidiaries for this quarter, it has in fact come down because of what would happen in Nipuna from '96 close to '93, '94 close. So that way there is roughly around $0.5 million revenue that got added lower than last quarter. So overall on a consolidated basis, if you look at all subsidiaries together, they have contributed $0.5 million lower than what they have contributed last year. So from that point of view, I don't think it is correct to say that Satyam on a standalone basis has not done well. In fact, it has done better than last quarter, primarily because the contribution from subsidiaries has come down. JULIO QUINTEROS: Okay. And then on the last part, just in terms of reconciling, looking at the trajectory on the headcount additions, looking at the trajectory on new client additions, some of the other core business lines, the EBS business in particular, all pointing in the right direction. Yet when we think about the trajectory for the rest of the year, holding the guidance, how to you reconcile that?. Because if you just sort of take some of these -- the positive momentum in a couple of items that when we look at the model, how do you reconcile that with just holding the line on the guidance for the full year? Is it more a function of trying to be conservative here in an uncertain environment or is the business really under some other duress that's just not apparent to us right now on the outside?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: I mean, yes, I mean, when we give the -- when we reiterated the guidance of 24% to 26% in US GAAP, I think we have kind of done a reality check and we feel comfortable that we will be able to achieve. And what was shortfall of $7 million in the business that we have seen, we thought that that will be quickly recovered in the quarters to come. So from that point of view, at this point in time, the guided number of 26% growth, we are comfortable with that. JULIO QUINTEROS: Okay. And that guidance also is working off of the higher revenue number for the June quarter, the $637 million?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. JULIO QUINTEROS: Okay. Sorry. And then lastly on the [Upaid] lawsuit, can you talk a little bit about what's going on there and what additional information you could provide, given the all-out list that they've put on you guys in terms of reaching out to the street? Where are you guys in that regards and what can we expect to see in terms of this legal issue outstanding?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: We are closely pursuing this and it is [subject] at this point in time. And we will not be able to comment too much on it other than just saying that the case is a posted for June 2009 and until that time I think we have to wait and see. And at the same time, we are basically very confident about our case and we are basically clear that we have not done anything to prejudice the customer. We have done whatever he wanted and all that. So from that point of view, we are very, very confident from the facts of the case that we will be able to defend our case when it comes -- for the hearing in mid of next year. JULIO QUINTEROS: Okay. Great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead. KAWALJEET SALUJA, ANALYST, KOTAK SECURITIES: Yes, my question has been answered. Thanks. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Saluja. The next question is from the line of [Hebesh Banjavi] from [Velega Securities]. Please go ahead. HEBESH BANJAVI, ANALYST, VELEGA SECURITIES: Good evening to the management (technical difficulty). My question is again regarding the guidance. If we will exclude the six point (technical difficulty) of -- in the Satyam BPO, we'll be still short of $1 million in [guidance]. I assume that when the management is giving their guidance, there will be such a margin of safety that the management is living with itself. So is it something beyond BPO that has gone wrong in 2008 business or (technical difficulty)?. RAM MYNAMPATI: I'm not so sure whether we can dissect it to such an extent other than to say that there are obviously going to be the timing issues relating to this one. When would we, for example, we mentioned already that we won three large deals. It depends on when the large deals will get operationalized and there might be a timing issue related to that. These things happened every quarter. I don't think we should read into it any more than what we do normally other than to say that a significant contribution came from the loss of business on the BPO side. The rest of it is a timing issue. That's the reason why we have given fairly strong guidance for Q2 as reaffirmed the guidance for the year because we feel comfortable about our ability to deliver. HEBESH BANJAVI: Okay. Thank you and all the best. RAM MYNAMPATI: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Banjavi. The next question is from the line of [David Norton] from [Netzke Capital]. Please go ahead. DAVID NORTON, ANALYST, NETZKE CAPITAL: That's all right. My question was just asked several questions ago. Thanks. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Norton. The next question is from the line of Nimesh Mistry from M.F. Global. Please go ahead. NIMESH MISTRY, ANALYST, M.F. GLOBAL: Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to know, for the next quarter guidance, what are the assumptions on pricing and utilization?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: We, basically, for the entire year, we have factored in stable pricing so that is what we have done in the beginning of this fiscal and we are continuing with that stand, looking at -- taking into consideration what has happened in Q1. So stable pricing and also in terms of learning factor, as least in our model, the assumption is to basically remain at the current levels. But of course, we may color the first to improve it from the current levels. But at least the assumption is that the learning factor remains at current levels. NIMESH MISTRY: Any reason as to decline -- marginal declining pricing in this quarter?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: It is very, very insignificant. A few cents -- $0.05 in offshore and maybe $0.10 in onsite. So it is definitely quarter-on-quarter revelation and we are not basically seeing a trend there. We expect -- there is right now onsite at Q4 levels and we expect them to remain at Q4 levels going forward as well. NIMESH MISTRY: Okay. Thanks. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Mistry. The next question is from the line from Mr. Anthony Miller from Arete Research. Please go ahead. ANTHONY MILLER, ANALYST, ARETE RESEARCH: Yes, hello, gentlemen. Just a few bits and pieces from questions asked before. Utilization -- if you're now saying that you're measuring utilization in line with peers when you're 75% excluding trainees, let's look at Infosys, for example. They say their comfort zone is somewhere between 76% and 80%. So does that mean that now you have anything up to 500 basis points of utilization to play with?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: I mean, yes, this comfort [June], I think, that is maybe waiting from company to company, but it's definitely a learning factor is one of the important metrics that we keep track on a daily basis. We have real time resource coordination sale monitoring it. So this is one of the important focus areas and we will basically make all of the first to increase it from the current levels. Other than that, we will not be able to give any guidance about any particular range. But definitely we'll make all efforts to improve this further. ANTHONY MILLER: But you can't say that your peak is either 78% or 80%. You don't have a view as to how hard you could really drive the utilization?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: I mean, it is reasonable to assume that, yes, maybe 78% to 80% is something we can -- we can quickly achieve and also sustainable over the longer period. Yes, we agree with that. ANTHONY MILLER: Okay. Sustainable over the longer period. Okay. Coming onto pricing and our odd clients or two expressing a desire to come in at a lower price, obviously, I guess, their desires must have been fulfilled to some extent. But where you do have to concede pricing to clients, what do they have to give in return? Are you able to extract any greater volumes from them?. RAM MYNAMPATI: Well, Anthony, this is Ram Mynampati here. I think I should maybe correct what seemed to have been understood. I did not say that customers are coming in at lower prices. I said one odd customer could have asked for a lower price in terms of negotiation. I don't mean to suggest that new clients came in at lower price. So if there was an interpretation of that, I would like to stand corrected. That was intended to be that way. ANTHONY MILLER: Not new clients. On existing clients. RAM MYNAMPATI: Yes, so -- and that is expected, particularly in environments that are challenged due to the economic conditions and all that. But by and large, there are a number of reasons why the pricing is different between client A and client B. It has something to do with the relationship intimacy. It has something to do with the size of the deal. It has something to do with the type of solutions that we are delivering. It -- a host of things that play a role. The competitive [situation] in the deal and the strategic value for the client was in a given market segment. I'm sure you understand the business side of it. But our desire of this leads to strike deals at the highest possible price and we will have to make whatever decisions that are appropriate in line with the business deals that we expect to achieve. ANTHONY MILLER: Just to be clear on this, you have had clients where you have renegotiated terms at lower prices. RAM MYNAMPATI: No, this quarter we don't have any such instances. I was just saying that just as much as we have new customers coming in at higher-than-average prices, you would have clients that would express a desire to have a lower price -- lower-than-average price. That average that I was referring to, not -- but there are different instances of that happening in this quarter. ANTHONY MILLER: Oh, okay. And just finally on Citisoft, which showed a loss this quarter, am I right in thinking this is the first time it's actually shown a loss?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Anthony, I think if you look at the last few quarters, there were a lot of incidences where it made losses. And of course, last quarter is then -- it made, yes, last quarter there was a profit at that level and also Q3. So, I mean, I don't think this is the first time. When we acquired it was making losses. And after that the performance has improved and there normal explaining this quarter is again an aberration. And going forward, Q2 and Q2 and Q4, we expect the performance to improve here. ANTHONY MILLER: Okay. So it's not a trend because we have particularly financial services or banking space to just a one off?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. ANTHONY MILLER: Okay. All right. Thank you very much indeed. RAMALINGA RAJU: Thank you. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Miller. The next question is from the line of Mr. [Saneil Tarumali] from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. SANEIL TARUMALI, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Hello, [all]. Thank you very much. My questions have been answered. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Tarumali. The next question is from the line of Mr. [Hamine Regandi] from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. HAMINE REGANDI, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: I thank for the [question]. I think somebody else's question before also, was there a kind of negative surprise in the tangible numbers also because quarter-on-quarter growth has really slowed down in the stand-alone part of the business. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, I mean, basically, we -- as we were mentioning, under the Indian GAAP consolidation, we have guided 2,520 gross also. And we have achieved 2,620. So that -- there is no change in that. I mean, the change comes from when we talk of US GAAP, when we are doing the translation. That is when that [$7.5 million]. Otherwise an Indian GAAP will already be reported. That number is basically the number that we arrived at by converting the dollars into rupees on the day the transaction takes place. HAMINE REGANDI: Indian GAAP stand-alone numbers than will fit into USD, based on the realized gains at 2% quarter-on-quarter growth. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. HAMINE REGANDI: That looks to be lower than that 3.5% guidance for the quarter which you give. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, no, no. We never give, for Indian GAAP, we never give guidance in dollars. We always talk about rupees. And the dollar guidance we give only in US GAAP. So from that point of view, there is no confusion at all because the Indian GAAP is always in rupees. We never talk in dollar terms. So in rupee terms, the last quarter we said that the quarter-on-quarter growth in rupee terms is going to be around 3.9% or so. Adding that we have achieved 8.5%. HAMINE REGANDI: Oh, thanks. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Regandi. The next question is from the line of [Vivian Nagaragin] from [G.M. Financial]. Please go ahead. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN, ANALYST, G.M. FINANCIAL: Hi. Just a follow-up to the pricing question. What is the pricing that you've factored into your full-year dollar guidance?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Flat pricing -- that is what we have factored in at current quarter levels. That is what we have factored in. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: If I recall your last guidance which you gave in April, that we had factored in the flat pricing for 4Q levels, which should have given us 2% insight --. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes and then --. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: -- that has come down, right?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, no. That is basically the same because if you look at our Q1 pricing and Q4 pricing, they are flat. They are not -- no difference at all. There is a -- there is a decline of around $0.05 in offshore and maybe $0.10 in onsite. So from that point of view, we are talking the same language. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: Right. Now if you (inaudible - background noise) earlier, we've seen a similar trend over the last few quarters with your [compensation] as well. Do you expect run to see it revived in (inaudible - background noise) -- because this is going to have a second pricing in it. RAM MYNAMPATI: Yes, which is what I was alluding to earlier when I was talking about enterprise applications as a group. We feel fairly positive about the potential for enterprise applications. And not only do we feel positive about, but we see a lot of opportunities in this space continuing to be visible in the market. So we remain fairly upbeat about the market. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: But somehow I don't see that perspective in your [riding] numbers. So we've seen one of the lowest additions in terms of international -- in terms of the international business impacted, as low as 116 employees in terms of net addition. Can you explain to us why -- do you feel comfortable about this kind of addition given your growth expectations?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: No, the net addition is not 161. It is 651. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: Yes, that's including the domestic and the sales, right? That is the total of the domestic and the sales [function] looking at 116 addition in the international business. To be precise around nine in offshore and the rest in onsite. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: Right? So why the -- I'm trying to understand why the numbers are so low. Since the last quarter or last year, the same quarter we had recruited close to 2,900 people net. RAMALINGA RAJU: In any case, what we have guided for the year as compared to last year is lower, quite obviously. And we are fairly comfortable with the plan that we have put in place for the -- for [riding] during the year and I have seen [stated] every year. We have planned for 14,000 to 15,000 gross additions during the year. And we expect to be able to have at least that kind of recruitment done. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: Right. And what is the pressure addition that you expect over the year?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: That is basically anywhere between 45% to 50% of the total additions will be from the pressures category. And of course, now it is -- and we were to include it. Historically, if you look at -- it is roughly around 40% to 50% and we would like to take it up to 60%. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: Right. And these pressures are joining in the next quarter, the bulk of the pressures?. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Yes, the next two couple of quarters, I think most of these additions will happen. VIVIAN NAGARAGIN: All right. Thanks. All the best for you. SRINIVAS VADLAMANI: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you, Ms. Nagaragin. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand this floor over to the management for their closing comments. RAMALINGA RAJU: Thank you, Rochelle, and thanks to all of you, for dialing in and for your active participation.

[SMLTAR](https://smltar.com/embeddings.html#glove) presents word2vec is a somewhat confusing manner, as it seems to conflate the pretrained vectors produced by Google with the actual model. This has been a source of confusion for me for quite some time, but I think I understand it now. The code below doesn't involve any pretrained vectors or models, though we can access those if needed.\n",
